So how does this relate to GPUs?

Transistor count is increasing much faster than performance.

Lets take the RTX 4090 vs RTX 3090:

https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-4090.c3889

The RTX 4090 has **76 billion** transistors. The 3090? Only 28 billion.

We are not their priority anymore and we are doomed to either buy consoles, or be fine with previous generation cards unless some new players comes into the market. Intel could be it, but I guess that as soon as they get some traction they will just act like nVidia and AMD do.

Another thing I can see happening, is that another smaller player can start producing GPUs using cheaper and older nodes. No need to be in the latest node for a GPU to be good.

Of course it will not compete with the latest nVidia and AMD offerings, but they should be cheaper.

u/eman_sdrawkcab,"Yeah, it's a term that's lost any meaning. It inspired me to look into what is actually involved in optimizing a game and my non-expert understanding is that it mostly comes down to ensuring that the game only loads things that are immediately noticeable to the player, e.g. textures for things the player is currently looking at or only modelling AI behaviour for NPCs in the immediate proximity. This allows most of the resources to be dedicated to what's currently on screen vs what's 'behind' the screen and in the distance. 

This is also *incredibly* difficult and time consuming to do without things like loading screens or the player noticing pop-in etc. It's also something that has diminishing returns, meaning actual optimization comes down to how consistent the game is at running on the intended hardware vs how long it would take to improve that performance. It's why some games force you to slow down in certain areas or why 90% of game time in the original Mass Effect was spent riding elevators on the citadel; it allows things to load in the background without having to look at an actual loading screen. 

My (again, non-expert) impression of performance issues with the Last of Us is that it has something to do with how inefficiently the game allocates textures to VRAM. It was built for the PS5 which has amazing storage/memory capabilities not yet available on PCs and thus the game is fundamentally designed around not loading things the way most PC games do.

And if that process crashed, they had to wait another day.  

So lets say you fix/add/move 50 things on the map on day one, then come back the next day to check on the results ...you need to move some of these object 3 to 6 times before you are happy with the actual result.  
You spend the entire week messing with one object, which in Unreal would be done in 2 minutes, drag and dop, check the result live done.  

This sort of thing will drive you slowly mad.

I think this is part of the issue. The highest settings in a game absolutely *shouldn't* be playable by anything other than the best graphics cards at the time of its release. The highest settings should be pushing the boundaries so that when people play it years from now on better hardware, the game won't look as dated. 

I do agree with the rest of your post in regards to scalability etc. but the vast majority of complaints I've seen about a game being 'unoptimised' are from people who refuse to accept that 'high' and 'ultra' actually mean 'high' and 'ultra'. 

The only people who can truly know how well optimized a game is are obviously the Devs, but subjectively it should just be 'how well does this game perform compared to other games with similar graphical fidelity' and whether there's a good reason for any discrepancies e.g. open world is substantially more taxing than a linear one.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

<p>I think this is part of the issue. The highest settings in a game absolutely <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be playable by anything other than the best graphics cards at the time of its release. The highest settings should be pushing the boundaries so that when people play it years from now on better hardware, the game won&#39;t look as dated. </p>

<p>I do agree with the rest of your post in regards to scalability etc. but the vast majority of complaints I&#39;ve seen about a game being &#39;unoptimised&#39; are from people who refuse to accept that &#39;high&#39; and &#39;ultra&#39; actually mean &#39;high&#39; and &#39;ultra&#39;. </p>

<p>The only people who can truly know how well optimized a game is are obviously the Devs, but subjectively it should just be &#39;how well does this game perform compared to other games with similar graphical fidelity&#39; and whether there&#39;s a good reason for any discrepancies e.g. open world is substantially more taxing than a linear one.</p>

This should be taken into consideration with every debate regarding the value proposition. We have to compare apples to apples, and consoles can only run games in native 4K at 30 FPS and medium settings. Many PC (and not necessarily with top notch hardware) can do this.

When devs want their game at 60 FPS, then they drop resolution most of the time by using variable resolution and that is not 4K.

1) most internet in the States doesn't go over 1Gbps anyway. so a board with a 2.5Gbps ethernet connection is kind of pointless. on top of that, a add in card could add that capability to any board. 

2) two PCIE 4 M.2 slots is another special use case, most people would be fine with one. also another case where a add in card could add that capability to any modern board. 

3) onboard wifi is nice, but a tad redundant. especially if you're going to hardware the computer in to the network with the 2.5Gbps ethernet connection. also another feature that could be added via expansion card, or even a USB dongle. 

4) USB 3 headers are common. this will mostly depend on the case you pick anyway. the board needs to have the connection on it to make use of it, but the front panel connections are going to be determined by the case you pick. 

5) BIOS reset buttons on the back of the board are nice, but pretty much all boards have the reset pins on them already. maybe a little more difficult to get to, but a button could be wired up fairly easily during the build and then left inside the case somewhere. i mean, realistically, how often do you need to use it anyway.

6) loads upon loads of boards will have the headers, but like you point out they may be in awkward locations. extension cables and harnesses are abundant and cheap, and will work with any modern board. you don't really even need two of them, just one, the plug in your harness, and split it off to other fans.

<p>like we tell customers at the shop i work, small costs extra. so yeah, that&#39;s all special use case, that is not in any way representative of the average needs. the examples i pointed out of customers coming in with high end boards, where they&#39;re using mid range CPUs, and the power pins aren&#39;t hooked up correctly, could&#39;ve just used the $80 boards i&#39;m using/have used. </p>

<p>these people are using standard ATX stuff. they don&#39;t need two m.2 slots, their internet is often much slower than 1Gbps, they&#39;re typically using wifi anyway, etc, etc.</p>

u/doneandtired2014,"Yep. 

I got into an argument with a guy about the architectural weaknesses of AMD, why it's a mistake to stay the course even as their competitors lap them in RT and MMU development (tensor cores), and why that is crippling their marketshare beyond intentionally deprioritizing Radeon products for wafer allocation for so much of RDNA2's life.

His argument kept coming down to price and how he got his 6800 XT for $550ish and how I must have overpaid for my 3080. Or how awesome the 6600 XT and 6700 XT are compared to NVIDIA's offerings.

AMD's offers a much higher performing product at a lower price depending on the segment...*NOW*.

I bought my 3080 the same week the 6800 XT launched in 2020 and there was a $0 to $20 difference between the board partners with like for like skus (reference models were sold out). My 3080 FTW3 ended up being cheaper than the Sapphire 6800 XT I had been eyeing.

After that, they were basically vaporware for 6 months. If you wanted one, you couldn't buy one even at scalper pricing because AMD didn't bother to make any in any real volume.

When the stock was finally made and shipped to retail, they were priced just as high as NVIDIA'S offerings were if not more so: 6700 XTs were routinely selling for $900 to $1000 at Microcenter, 6800s didn't exist, 6800 XTs were $1400, and 6900 XTs were $2300+.

A gpu basically has 2 parts, compute and storage.
A gpu is responsible for rendering the scene which involves a lot of math and executing multiple shaders. A gpu will have compute units for this, nvidia has Cuda cores for this. Laptop has 6k ish, desktop has 8.7k or so.
Another factor that impacts compute is clock speed, which tells you how fast those units run. So desktop is 1.7 ghz laptop is 1.25.
