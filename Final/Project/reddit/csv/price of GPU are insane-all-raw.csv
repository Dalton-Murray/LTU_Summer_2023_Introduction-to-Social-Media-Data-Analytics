The greed of GPU manufacturers, and it is purely their greed at this point, is damaging to the entire platform.

u/GameStunts,"I think it will push some out.

My argument for PC Gaming was always that yes, at launch, a console would seem better value for the graphical power that you get, but within a year you'd be able to build a PC for the same or less that would compete, and in the long term, the pricing of PC Games and sales eco system meant you had more choice and spent less.

But for casual to semi regular players who are buying into COD, Battlefield, and esports titles like Rocket League, Apex etc, it's going to be hard to ignore.

My main problem with all of this pricing hike is what will pricing the mid range GPUs look like?

On it's year of release, the GTX 1060 with 6gb of ram was $299. That's not even the entry or budget GPU, those were the 1050ti that were $199. It was also a huge jump in performance. The 1060 landed somewhere very close to 980 performance levels.

Even adjusting for inflation a 1060 would be about $370 today. Can you imagine Nvidia launching the 4060 at $370 or $399? I think it's more likely going to roll out at $499 at least given where they're positioning the 4070ti.

The 1060 was a solid choice for anyone wanting to game at 1080p. And the pricing going up from there made sense, you were getting less frames per dollar, but you paid more and more halo tier pricing to go up a level.

Now that has been flipped on it's head. The best value per dollar is the $1600 monster, and the lower tiers don't even reflect the drop in performance in their pricing. A 4070ti at $799 (which you'll never see since they didn't make any founders models, all the reviewers were sent ASUS TUF which are $850), what the hell are we going to possibly tell people wanting to start into PC Gaming? Go buy a 4 year old secondhand GPU?

It's not the end of PC Gaming, but it's definitely going to be a black mark on the road map.","<div class=""md""><p>I think it will push some out.</p>

In any case it's really a shame what they've done for the budget consumer in gaming capable desktop builds. Personally I've always gone for the low to mid-range.  My current desktop build I did a couple couple years ago has a 1660 Super I bought new for around 250 USD.  It's perfectly fine for 1080p/60 but for anything better it's going to struggle.

So I'm going stick with my current hardware for a while yet.  I seriously can't justify the cost of a new video card as a casual PC gamer.  In times past I would be looking at updating my card and monitor about now.

u/ExTrafficGuy,"Linus was talking about this the other day, and I agree with his take on it. Basically, it's your fault. Well, maybe not you specifically, but consumers who desperately bought GPUs at grossly inflated prices during the pandemic. Nvidia's primary responsibility as a company, as any organization, is to deliver the best ROI for its investors. As the dominant market leader, they're going to charge the maximum amount the market is willing to bare. And the market showed it was willing to pay 50% higher prices than in the past. Other companies like AMD were of course going to follow suit, because they also have to maximize ROI. 

The good news is that GPU sales are at a 20 year low. Anecdotal reports indicate that the 4080 isn't selling. Response to the 4080 12GB, now the 4070 Ti, has been tepid at best. Both directly due to being poor value propositions for consumers. I expect Nvidia will lower prices in the next year.

In all seriousness, GPU prices are unreasonable.

I doubt console sales will skyrocket either because of their prices in general. I know a lot of people who wouldn't want to drop even $500 on a locked environment that will become outdated and not upgradable in what seems like a short amount of time for some people.

Getting games is now a trivial matter. Instead of dealing with skull/crossbones stuff, now for something similar to USD 60 one can get a top of the line AAA Game, with a minimum of fuss.

But today's AAA games are basically unplayable on today's most used GPUs (onboard GPUs such as Intel UHD series). So, game companies are missing a lot of people who would gladly pay them money for their games, because such people cannot play their titles.

<p>Theyre all such suckers and seem to think all they need to do is stick together the most expensive hardware they can find. (Causing huge price jumps) 
They dont rwally want to get involved in software configuration (pretty much the entire other 80% of using homemade conputers to play games with) so they come here amd post one after another  ‘i have a 13900 and a 4090, why are my franerate not in the three figures?!’ Post. Never even talking about their drivers, or game settings, oh no, why? Well because Linus doesnt talk about drivers he talks about hardware and maybe the firmware bios! (Which he is sponsored to do, dipshits!)
And then they take it all to our developers and blame them for not having the latest hardware features like DLSS when the fucking game’s engine is 6 years old. </p>

<p>A xbox or playstation is 600$ and works right out of the box! It has exclusive games olus almost every game we play onPC except RTS games. You can play it woth your girlfriend and you can even trade game disks! Theres a VR headset, all solidstate and everything tested to work together!</p>

<p>I dont know what drove people away from consoles, (because ive never owned one) but i really think it suits alot of people’s needs.

I think this is still mostly an issue with Nvidia graphics, that a lot of negative propaganda is still out about Radeon graphics, and that aside from DLSS and RT heavy calculation, that a jump is totally worthwhile if you are OK with learning a different approach to graphics driver processing. Been running a 6000 series card for almost 6 months, no serious compromise I can identify.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

u/kryndon,"The problem with consoles is you can't really use them the same way as a PC. Meaning, when I come back home, I want to sit on my comfy desk and use a keyboard and mouse to browse the web, listen to music, maybe have CAD or something open to draw, commune on discord, watch youtube, chat on Facebook, and then alt-tab back into a performance intensive game.

The PC, especially medium-higher end build, is the only thing that offers this. It's like the swiss knife of tech.

If I had to pay a few grand extra to get a console and all its required extra hardware, then pay a few hundred to a thousand to have a decent non-gaming PC or laptop, I'm still spending more for it all combined, rather than upgrading my PC to remain relevant.

So in conclusion, the price hike of GPUs alone is not nearly enough of a serious reason to completely jump the bandwagon to console. That said, yes, the pricing on pretty much everything is abhorrent and like somebody said lower down, high-end gaming is now mostly for the wealthy.

With the ad generation they added the 3 and bumped everything bellow it up one to confuse people. 

If we look at the 4k series they have made the 4080 on a mid range chip, that isn't bigger than the last few gens of mid range, put it on a $400 pcb with $200 worth of ram, and want $1200  for it.   There is no reason a mid range chip should be going on a board that expensive or should be 300  watts. We are also not seeing a $850 4070ti on a low end chip.

u/cutterjohn42,"nVidia and AMD to a lesser extent got addicted to cryptomining fad prices...

Thank the gods that Intel isn't a shit in their prices...

also tyvm nvidia for kicking evga out of the AIB market... hopefully they come back on board with intel

EDIT:

Hell even mobo prices are ass right now. They're at a MINIMUM double of what they SHOULD cost and AMD is trying to hide it with their truly ass lowend chipset for AM5...

e.g. I purchased a x670e PG lightning for $250 which is the lowest of the low x670e mobos, meanwhile a few years ago I purchased a x370 fatal1ty gaming pro for the SAME price.  Go ahead, compare the feature set.

PG Lightning is a $100 board at best and there is NOTHING on it to justify its 2.5X price point, look at all the corners cut v. x370 fatal1ty gaming pro at SAME price point ffs! And I don't mean they just cut a FEW corners, I mean that they threw the baby out,the bathwater out, the bathtub out, you threw yourself out etc.

EDIT2:

MEANWHILE the TRULY INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE component, i.e. CPUs have NOT SKYROCKETED in pricing, go figure... as a matter of fact they kind of tried to raise price but that phailwhaled almost immediately...

EDIT3:

And I guess w/nVidia at least the problem is that they gave up on consumer only silicon and are fusing off pieces of their stupidly expensive stupidly large w/incredible defect rate monolithic chunks of silicon... sorry nvidia let your business customers carry the freight for your poor design decisions...

Sure, because the 3060ti was $400 and many of them are around MSRP at the moment.

> I think it will push some out.

I completely disagree. I think the issue here is you guys are too focused on the best and not what delivers good performance. For the VAST majority of PC gamers there's absolutely no reason to even go above the 2xxx series, something which is reflected in steam hardware surveys.

Yeah sure, we don't get shiny settings like RTX (at playable framerates) or native 4k, but why am I buying anything above the xx60ti lines to play games? At some point there's a huge amount of diminishing returns and I have to believe people are just doing it because they enjoy taking screenshots. Almost no games require that power to run at 1440 < and with DLSS 4k is achievable without needing them either. Unless someone wants to brag they can do native 4k at 60fps or whatever then I guess that's cool, but for the vast majority of gamers I don't think they care that much.

GPU pricing isn't an issue with the mid ranged cards since they are at MSRP (and are reasonable) and most games aren't even pushing those, so why bother? I guess enthusiasts are pissed but since I've always been a mid range andy I guess I'm not as annoyed as others.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Let's not forget that many people were flush with extra cash during that time from the government stimuli, making paying extra for a new GPU, when faced with the prospect of staying inside for the foreseeable future, seem like a good deal. Nvidia clearly didn't consider that the outdoors still exist when pricing the latest generation.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

That’s only true to a very small degree. Most of the price difference is simply taxes, which in the EU are always included in the stated price whereas on the US it’s only added at the time of purchase. So you can’t compare EU prices to US prices, because they’re not the same kind of prices. Most of the time, the launch prices are almost exactly the same as US MSRP, plus taxes. It varies a bit depending on location (and therefor buying power) and currency conversion, but overall, the prices really are pretty much the same for the actual GPU itself, minus taxes and other fees.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

u/SvijetOkoNas,"I would actually argue this in a different way sort of. Let me explain.
First you are right, I have a 1070 and yes. You are 100% right of course but let me be realistic when it comes to games. 

I'm 3x year old. I am wealthy now. I remember when 1070 came out. I spend so many months saving. Now I could buy a 4090, I have the income, I have no kids, but why? I actually did spend the money mind you. I bought myself a Sony A6600 with entire Sigma Prime Lens Trio and A 18-50 Zoom lens and that wasn't enough so I went and got a Super Zoom Sony 70-350mm. When you sum it up it's more then a 4090.

But thats not the issue. Since I'm also old let me put it like this. 

When UT came out you needed a GPU or you were stuck at playing a 320x240 Software 400x300 if you had a really good CPU. UT was the game everyone played. It was the top game. Same goes for everything down the line. Half Life, Half Life 2, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, Red Alert 2, CnC Generals, Company of Heroes.

All these games needed better, newer, more capable hardware. 

Oh your GPU can't do the new version of DirectX too bad, oh your GPU can't do T&L too bad. You were blocked from playing games.

Now on my 1070 with 1080p60 am I blocked by anything? 

New games keep coming out, I see no issue or reason to upgrade.

Elden Ring? I could run it.
Ghostwire Tokyo? I could run it. 
TL Warhammer III? I could run it. 
OW2? I could run it technically but I am never playing a Blizzard game in my life every again no matter the quality.

The point being. Aside from the occasional mega hit that requires a good GPU most of the game that people play these days don't need one.

Vallorat, CS GO, Genshin Impact, Apex, Warzone, LoL, Dota 2, Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, PubG, Fall Guys and so on for the normal people.

All of these will run really well on 1080p60 with a 1060 6 GB. 

For the older guys like me Paradox Games, Dyson Sphere, Civ, Humankind, Anno 1800, Cities Skylines, and so on... they're all good with 1060.

And I mean you're seeing this with the PS5. I have one. It's sitting collecting dust because what am I going to play on it? People seem to be playing 95% PS4 games on it. And then an occasional hit comes out you play it for 1~4 weeks and you go back to the social games like FFXIV or Genshin or Apex etc... 

So it won't be the ending of PC gaming, it's going to be a stagnation of PC gaming. And more and more people will join because the entry level is going to be really cheap.","<div class=""md""><p>I would actually argue this in a different way sort of. Let me explain.
First you are right, I have a 1070 and yes. You are 100% right of course but let me be realistic when it comes to games. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 3x year old. I am wealthy now. I remember when 1070 came out. I spend so many months saving. Now I could buy a 4090, I have the income, I have no kids, but why? I actually did spend the money mind you. I bought myself a Sony A6600 with entire Sigma Prime Lens Trio and A 18-50 Zoom lens and that wasn&#39;t enough so I went and got a Super Zoom Sony 70-350mm. When you sum it up it&#39;s more then a 4090.</p>

<p>But thats not the issue. Since I&#39;m also old let me put it like this. </p>

u/unfeelka,"nah, I disagree. I get it, you’re supporting the narrative, but in no way do you need a brand new GPU on the first months of a generation launch to afford PCgaming. There are still RX6600 out there that can totally run everything in 1080p for a couple hundred euros. You don’t need to have a beast PC to play games, and in no way it is “solely affordable to wealthier people”. There are plenty of systems on the second-hand market too, you just need to look further than NVIDIA “latest releases” page. 

Obviously it doesn’t take the blame off of NVIDIA with this shitty launch, but I don’t like when people imply that you need a new and fancy GPU for an average gamer.","<div class=""md""><p>nah, I disagree.

halo product. Nvidia can almost charge whatever they want and still sell out of it. in part since a lot of people use it for work due to cuda and the time saved means you will quickly earn the cost back. and in part since some people have one hobby so nearly unlimited cash to spend on that.

it is the 4070ti and 4080 sales you should look at which have been god awful.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Define a bit though. Half those a ""bit more"" builds are way late in the gen, including optional expenses for the consoles, completely excluding input devices, some acting like people are gonna buy half a dozen gamepads on the reg, excluding software costs, and etc. 

Like yeah Windows was free for a long time, but if you don't have an existing license to sub in it's not actually free. I can get excluding screen/panel costs cause that comes up no matter the platform though, but excluding input on PC also doesn't make sense... console includes input for one person PC does not. Even cheap ass input is gonna cost about $20 on the budget. Also worth mentioning how many of those builds cut corners on PSU and mobo which have a hell of a lot of impact on the lifespan of the build.

u/fashric,I'm not sure I agree as both have had issues that have made headlines but maybe it just doesn't stick with Nvidia? I honestly don't know what the problem is for AMD. They have the better cards and price points in the low-mid range which should be an easy sell for people looking for cards in that range but it just doesn't happen for them. I mean you could argue that RT performance and dlss sell it for Nvidia but both of those are pretty poor on the lower/mid range. RT hardly runs on anything below a 3060ti and dlss doesn't perform as well at lower resolutions. So people should be looking at raw rasterization performance numbers which AMD trashes Nvidia on. I'm on a 3070 which I was lucky to get at rrp last year and will be likely skipping until there is a card the doubles the performance of the 3070 at around the £500-£600 price point.,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m not sure I agree as both have had issues that have made headlines but maybe it just doesn&#39;t stick with Nvidia?

u/Mission-Property-498,"It doesn't matter because AMD is charging what should be a $100-130 card for $200. There's no way a card was released 6 years ago with a larger GPU so more silicon and a larger bus memory pool considering the time it was released. If you going to make the inflation argument why was a GPU that cost $200 in 2010, not as a GPU that cost $200 in 2016? And surely if inflation from 2016/2017 to 2021/2022 was at a push 15-20% surely then we'd get a GPU with the same die size as the RX 480 at $220-250 instead of close to $400. There's never been a period of time in which the same amount of money couldn't have got you an upgrade.

&#x200B;

You talk about silicon prices going up explain the 5700xt costing $400-450 in 2019 which had a similar GPU die size to the rx 480... The die size is clearly what matters the most it's the big silicon GPU.

 You clearly have no understanding of how these things are made because the 5700xt couldn't have really cost much more to make than the rx 480. It was built on TSMC 7nm so there's a little bit of a difference in cost per wafer but the actual GPU was smaller than the RX 480 and cards like the 5600xt had less memory and a smaller bus but still cost quite a lot more.

I wouldn't even bring MSRP into the discussion because the gtx 1070 and 1070 ti were always at or often below MSRP. During the entire lifecycle of the 3000 series and even the 2000 series, GPUs were never below MSRP. The 2080ti was a $999 MSRP GPU but it was always $1200 the 2070 super was $50 over MSRP.

Go look up the supposed MSRP of the GTX 1060 it was $299 but the GPU was often sold below $240 so if you're saying MSRP is unfair because of inflation. The MSRP of pascal was almost the highest price anyone paid for these GPUs whereas they were the absolute lowest prices people paid for the 3000 series.

u/SD-777,"Well they have to stop Nvidia from continuing to take away their market share.  The $799 4070ti comparing as favorably as it does with AMD's newest offerings, while also offering some RT performance and frame generation, will be tough for AMD to fight as they are priced today.  It's not too far behind the XTX, and from what I understand that's without frame generation or RT, and close enough to the XT where Nvidia's much larger marketing and market penetration, as well as the $100-$200 off will probably skew the market heavily in their favor, again.

u/McWormy,"It's always been the case.  I used to go along the lines of 1080 = 2070 or 3070 = 2080.  But I can't explain anything regarding the latest pricing.  It's madness to me.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that a GPU you can get a lot cheaper now such as a 1080 TI are far more viable than a 4 series and will still play the latest games.  Yes you may not get all the RTX or DLSS, etc. features but you will still get a performant graphics card.

You can get a 1080 TI for around £200-250 - you can get a 4090 for around £1500.  That's 6 times more expensive (using the higher figure).  Is the real world performance really 6 times better than a 1080 TI?

I'll likely get a 3 or 4 series graphics card at some point but that will be likely when the 6 series is out and they've gone down to the same price point that a 1080 TI is at now.  The thing is, years ago when we were moving through new architecture there seemed to always be a valid reason to change was 3DFX, AGP, PCI Express, DX 12, etc.  At the moment, the main thing seems to be RTX and DLSS which are, in my eyes, nice to haves they're not essential to haves.","<div class=""md""><p>It&#39;s always been the case.

u/ArmsForPeace84,"No argument here. Nvidia has gone nuts on pricing of their new GPUs, which they can keep.

But there remains ample room in the PC gaming space for 1080p and 1440p/2K gaming on a budget. And speaking as a long-time console gamer who returned to PC gaming recently, it is, by far, a better experience than consoles.

Some people would add, ""except for 4K gaming"" here, but I won't. The Series X and PS5, only rocking as they are merely the equivalent of an RX 6650 XT, are heavily reliant on compromises to make these resolutions happen.

See new release God of War: Ragnarok, which offers players the option to lock the frame rate at 60fps, and allow the dynamic resolution to dip as low as 1440p, or to lock it at 30fps and play in 4K. Because nothing says welcome to the future like playing action games at 30fps.

So I think it's a disservice to would-be PC gamers sounding out what to expect in performance and value, to *even unintentionally* feed the perception that consoles are a better value, by conflating the 1080p and 1440p/2K tier GPUs with their massively more overpriced cousins at the top end of the market.

With these higher-end cards existing largely to, by sheer brute force, beat 4K textures into submission and fit them into a gaming space where this setting has always meant making compromises.

That's not a problem to worry about, today, unless one is similarly burdened by a fat wad of cash and a sense of urgency to be relieved of it. That's why Nvidia is getting away with it right now. If we all needed a 3090, or a 4090, we'd al be screwed. As it is? People are lining up to pay their asking price.

At least they didn't buy the 3080, and aren't buying it re-badged as the 3070 Ti. So they're not stupid. They're just early adopters. And early adopters getting the shaft is not just how Nvidia rolls. It's how tech rolls.","<div class=""md""><p>No argument here.

Its just not worth it atm.","<div class=""md""><p>not to dis your comment but have you seen the graphics comparisons on YouTube these days?

u/MonoShadow,"Disocclusion artifacts alone can reveal FSR 2  easily. Some door openings in Calisto were quite awful and I assume this game has the latest version. In the same HUB tests DLSS2 and newcomer XsSS XMX easily outperforms FSR 2. Mind you it's not bad, especially for the reach it has, but other vendors reconstruction offering are better. Dp4a XeSS doesn't exist. In my experience DF GoW analysis is still apt.

The question is how sensitive you are to those artifacts and how much you're willing to pay for better image reconstruction. Today I would not pay the same price for Radeon I will for Geforce if all things are equal. And there's no fanboyism in it. Geforce is just more well rounded product.","<div class=""md""><p>Disocclusion artifacts alone can reveal FSR 2  easily.

u/theBlackDragon,"Not sure what version Calisto Protocol was on, but FSR 2.2 was a pretty major upgrade wrt artefacting. The video I was referring to, but didn't link because I was replying on a phone, was [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85M3KxUtJk), by the way, and they came out fairly even in that testing.

In the end they're all upscaling and making up the difference, so there's bound to be artefacts. Only way to have perfect image quality is to play at native resolution, which means that for quite a lot of games 4K is right out.

As for the GeForce vs Radeon argument, I'm on my first AMD card since their graphics division was still ATI. For me nVidia's shenanigans (like their insane pricing, twice now, and the mandatory GeForce Now account) combined with the fact that AMD is getting very close to nVidia's performance the pendulum swung AMD's way this time around (well, last time, technically, since I'm on a 6000-series card atm)

u/JonWood007,"Yeah it's ridiculous. You have the 6600 at $250 and the 6650 XT for $275 currently but below that, the market is just broken. You got 1650s, 6400s, 6500 XTs, 1660s, 1660 tis, etc. all selling for within a few dollars of each other, with varying levels of performance. 

Like...the LOW LOW end market has ALWAYS been like this. You ALWAYS have poor GPU pricing at the low low end where you vary between say a GT 710 (bad) and say a 1050 ti (good), since that is now a 6 year old card and should rightfully be low end.

But normally....the NEW 50 cards are in that price range. And you always had good options in that price range. I remember when I got into PC gaming, you could get cards as good as the HD 3850 for like $130. You could get 4770s, 4830s, and 4850s for less than $200, and those cards rocked a lot of the time. You could get the GTS 250, and later the 5750 and even the 5770 (although that was closer to $200) at the time. Those were solid cards.

And later on, stuff like the GTS 450, GTX 750 Ti, 950, and 1050 Ti were all solid buys in the sub $200 range. You never got the best at that price range, you never got something super futureproof, but it was a price tier in its own right where you could get some value cards for around $150ish.

That market is drying up. The sub $100 market is just about GONE, we're selling 1030s for like $120 still last I looked which is freaking pathetic since that card should've gone for like $80 at launch. And we're still selling stuff like 1650s, 6400s, and 6500 XTs at that price range. THose cards have been down there for FOUR YEARS now, and there has been zero improvement per dollar. If anything, it's a regression. And with the $350-400 range being the new ""mid range"" and it seems like they're trying to turn the $200-300 area into the new ""budget"" category and the sub $200 market as that ""you're ####ed"" category, the market is just broken. 

To be fair i blame nvidia more than AMD at the moment for this. AMD has had good value deals on the 6600 and similar cards in the mid range range, which is quite frankly where they should've been all along (remember they cost $330-400 at launch), but ultimately, the low end of the market is feeling squeezed out, hard.","<div class=""md""><p>Yeah it&#39;s ridiculous.
