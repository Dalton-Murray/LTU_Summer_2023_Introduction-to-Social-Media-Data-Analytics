I watch a YouTube video a little while back and I personally agreed with the video.  He stated that for this generation, Nvidia and AMD opted for small production but for big profit margins, versus large production for small profit margins. 

 He said it's because Nvidia and AMD knew demand would be all time low for their GPUs this generation. Whether it was people being content with their last gen GPUs, or people aren't stuck at home anymore, and inflation being at all time high, their predictions where low for sales. The video also stated that the scalpers for last gen GPUs showed Nvidia and AMD that a certain portion of the community is willing to buy the latest and greatest, no matter the price.

u/AnAmbitiousMann,"For most games besides Control, metro exodus and maybe a few other titles. RT is either poorly implemented, poor optimized, or both. That said I don't mind playing at 60 fps with med-ultra settings with RT enabled and DLSS scaling on. I love how the light looks. Since most games with RT isn't an esports title I don't really care about getting 144+ fps. That said you are giving up smoother overall game play and potentially worse looking textures etc due to the up scaling. Although It's getting hardly noticeable at 1440p nowadays with up scaling on.

I've always held that if you're paying top top dollar for a GAMING gpu ($1000 usd or more). Then it's gotta have all the bells and whistles since you aren't really considering price to performance or overall value as you don't really care for that if you're dumping a grand or more on just 1 component for your PC. So I've always been team NVIDIA in that regard because they just have a better overall product, with the option for RT there.

RT is either poorly implemented, poor optimized, or both. That said I don&#39;t mind playing at 60 fps with med-ultra settings with RT enabled and DLSS scaling on. I love how the light looks. Since most games with RT isn&#39;t an esports title I don&#39;t really care about getting 144+ fps. That said you are giving up smoother overall game play and potentially worse looking textures etc due to the up scaling. Although It&#39;s getting hardly noticeable at 1440p nowadays with up scaling on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always held that if you&#39;re paying top top dollar for a GAMING gpu ($1000 usd or more). Then it&#39;s gotta have all the bells and whistles since you aren&#39;t really considering price to performance or overall value as you don&#39;t really care for that if you&#39;re dumping a grand or more on just 1 component for your PC. So I&#39;ve always been team NVIDIA in that regard because they just have a better overall product, with the option for RT there. Pretty inexcusable to have far inferior drivers and terrible RT performance on a $1k+ card at this point where we are the 3rd generation in for the RT technology.</p>

u/Vietwulf,"I think it goes without saying that the value per dollar from both companies is far from where most of us are comfortable. That being said, if you yourself place high value in RT as a feature, then you'd be well served purchasing any of the current Nvidia 40 series line, which at this point would be the 4070ti and up. As insane as it may sound, I think the 4090 actually technically may be a better value for the performance you get, but that's an astronomical amount of money and is in itself only good value because of how performant it is and how badly everything below it is priced. For RT, you really should get Nvidia.

u/Robochemist1234,"TL;DR Neither, both companies suck. Go Nvidia if you enjoy spending money.

It's collusion by Nvidia and AMD. AMD is more than happy being little brother to Nvidia in the graphics card space. They could be fighting (and winning) for more market share but announced they cut their chip supply to keep prices high.

I think gamers might be hosed. AI compute power can keep the demand up for GPU's. Nvidia will divert a pittance of high end cards our way if you've got the cash.

If you just want to game, I think I'm going to start recommending consoles. There is no chip shortage, GPU crypto mining is currently dead. There is no reason for the current lack of bargains other than a giant middle finger from AMD and Nvidia. They have us by the balls, and all we can do is walk away and bitch about it on social media.

There is one glimmer of hope. The used market is finally coming down. I saw 3060ti's on eBay for around $230. That's a legit bargain, IMO. I've been waiting 3 years for one. There was also literally a few minute window (almost as quick as the darkest times, where inventory sold out quicker than my browser could refresh) where Best Buy in the US had 3080 FE's for $415. That specific model is almost certainly gone, but keep an eye out for similar fire sales. Warehouse space must be cheap because there is a glut of last gen cards that haven't sold and they're happy trickling them out as to not get our hopes up.

If you can't tell I'm pretty jaded, but they haven't kicked all the hope out of me yet. Things cost what they cost, and I barely have time to play anymore. They've priced me out of the market, and anyway I'm too busy working to afford all the other crap that has shit (that was a typo for 'shot', but fuck it, I'm going to leave it) up in price. Half the fun for me has always been bargain hunting and building or upgrading to the best bang for the buck PC.

u/FrozenMongoose,"1. Not every game looks noticeably better with ray tracing enabled. I can think of 2 games that implement raytracing effectively, every other game either does not have raytracing or does not implement it well.

2. Not every game can run ray tracing without crashing on modern hardware. (Watch Daniel Owens recent video on RE4. He could not get the game to run with RT on @ 1440p with a 4070ti. A 1440p card according to Nvidia? lol)

3. You get a loss in frames and/or resolution for enabling it on modern hardware. A tradeoff which is going to be a hard sell for most people. 

4. RT is the only video fidelity feature that also utilizes the CPU. For anyone that is currently CPU bottlenecked in games, RT could cause significant performance drops as their CPU is the limiting factor.


I would equate RT to a 5% increase in fidelity for a -30% decrease in perormance. That is the average scenario with modern hardware right now.
The real question is why have you bought in so much to Nvidia's marketing that you see that tradeoff as beneficial right now?

I think there's a bit of confusion here. Those are all not exemplary implementations as they're all based on the RX platform that Nvidia developed.  Control and Minecraft in particular are poorly optimized when it comes to the ""public"" RT builds (and not the technology previews at launch). An acceptable benchmark would be a DX12U implementation that is not really too much unbalanced towards one manufacturer. Fortnite is the only one that is sufficiently neutral. The 7900 XTXC excels in that game.

Terrible is a stretch. 7000 series has some driver issues in a few specific VR titles. 6000 series seems to be completely fine.

Splitting hairs unless you're a professional streamer, in which case you should probably be using a dedicated streaming PC with CPU encoding anyway. AMF encoder is more than satisfactory for most people. I agree NVENC is slightly better, and has more widespread software adoption.

> Idle power consumption on a multi monitor high refresh rate systems is a problem for a lot now, but that's not a bug itself, it's by design.

I'm not seeing this anywhere. I'm also seeing reports of Nvidia having issues with multi-monitor setups, not waking from sleep, having to disconnect/reconnect, etc. This is hardly an AMD-specific issue. It also doesn't seem to be very widespread for either AMD or Nvidia, so YMMV.

I hate to always have to be an AMD shill, but the AMD haters and misinformation-ers are just so incredibly annoying and wrong a vast majority of the time.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

lol, the net is full of the idle power consumption and it is by design, look it up (multi-monitor setups and max vram clock).

<p>Known Issues</p>

<p>High idle power has situationally been observed when using select high-resolution and high refresh rate displays on Radeon™ RX 7000 series GPUs.</p>

<p>This will be fixed, probably.</p>

To explain; the most important harware feature for DXR performance outside of having ray intersection accelerators is shader core performance.
