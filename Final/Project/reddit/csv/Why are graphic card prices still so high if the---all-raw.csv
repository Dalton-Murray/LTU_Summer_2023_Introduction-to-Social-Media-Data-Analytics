u/bubblesort33," Economic downturn. So cards not selling isn't that abnormal.

Prices are high because really high inflation in the last 2 years that has probably been around 3-5x what we are used to at minimum. 

They are also keeping the top end really high to incentivise selling old stock. They don't care much that they aren't selling many RTX 4080 and 7900xtx. Especially since for the ones they are selling, they are making pretty nice margins.

If you were to account for inflation the prices we see on the Rx 6000 series is actually pretty normal, if not below the usual price drop we see. But to be honest, the 6600xt and 6600 should never have launched at the insane prices they did. Those should have really been $320 and $280 respectively.

But this is so far removed from the whole market that it doesn't matter. These guys get paid by the click, and if they post ""GPUs selling normally"" . . . who the fuck is gonna click that? They sensationalize everything and look for anything and everything to get you to click on their shit and give them attention.

2. We are in a weird GPU supply issue right now. There was a flood of GPUs and inventory that got piled up as Ethereum crashed last year (and eventually went POS).

The 8th gen consoles kept graphics from really requiring anything more than a GTX 970 or 1060 for many years. This value perception allows Nvidia to charge a lot more for a 3050.</p>

[deleted],"This generation for AMD and NVidia has mostly been the culmination of a massive amount of time and effort overcoming the obstacles of the various node shrinks. It used to be just shrinking the node and cramming more of the same cores in would bring major performance benefits, it still does, but it seems like it requires more effort and smarter designs as well to get there now.

My personal opinion is this generation is really just a stopgap for both companies to bring new designs and processes online, AMD seems to have got to chiplet based GPUs first but nVidia MUST have a chiplet design in the works. Their just squeezing everything they can out of a monolithic design first.

With everything that happened during the pandemic and chip shortage they will be keen to recoup every penny they can this generation. It doesn’t help that with the mindshare that exists around nVidias top tier cards, AMD procing their cards too low would make them ‘look’ cheap and inferior even if their not too far behind.

NVidia is currently the leader, so they get to set the prices, and it’s pretty clear they will always fuck over consumers in the name of profit. Until AMD or some other challenger takes back the crown, prices will never drop if nVidia have their way.

That’s not to say AMD might not have done the same if the roles were reversed, but I don’t think they are that cutthroat. Companies like nVidia and Intel have greed and shareholder profit as a core value of their company culture.

u/BeeeRyaAnnn,"It's just doing the same thing used cars are doing. May 2023 you can find pretty good deals. Look at RTX 3080TI on amazon new it's like reduced price, plus $250 off, plus $100 checkout coupon. $899 for brand new 3080TI I feel is pretty great.

&#x200B;

But some cards pricing is crazy and also places like Best Buy just left the old prices on so it's like $1450 for a 3-series card. Same with used cars you also see 25 year old used Toyota Camry's selling for $6,000 when it's worth close to zero zero zero. Too many people spent too much money buying when things were crazy high priced and now don't want to take a huge loss. Trust me they ARE going to take that loss but they are just keeping the price high until it never sells and they can do a tax dump thing.

&#x200B;

u/ImSpartacus811,"> Sales may be down from previous quarters, but it sort of works like New York real estate.

There are several key differences: 

* Unsold GPUs become outdated and lose value within a year or two. 

 * The real estate market is artificially propped up such that if you keep a property empty, it'll still be worth the same or even more. 

* The same AD102 die can be sold as a $10k L40 professional card or a $2k 4090 gaming card. So if Nvidia has no incentive to flood the gaming market with supply if they have enough professional demand. 

 * Real estate can technically be reconfigured for more profitable use cases (e.g. office vs residential vs retail), but it's an expensive/litigious process so you're often ""stuck"" with whatever use case it's already configured for, so you're more likely to need to keep it unoccupied.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

u/AncientRaven33,"It doesn't matter if prices are significantly down, they are still overpriced, starting with jacked up prices on the 2000 series, long before the US and EU started the money printer (read: inflation narrative).

Mid range (like the 1060 6GB I've bought for €200 a pop inc. VAT) used to be $200-300 for as long as I can remember since last Intel's agp dGPU being sold 2 decades ago. Now, you can buy for €300 a 3050, just to proof my case here what kind of value you get in return (a low end card vs mid range) for 1.5x the price it used to cost several years ago.

The entire gpu market is still a ripoff, while people think it's a good deal to buy a 2 year dated gpu near a jacked up MSRP on the 2nd hand market is throwing 3x salt in an open wound (as used prices for 2 year old usually is 50% or more depending on the usage and condition). Hell, I even heard and read stories from miners selling their old equipment for the same price they've bought them for, so they ran zero losses on investment + profits from mining. It's pretty self evident here who the winners and losers are.

If you can't control your emotions to buy right now to game AAA titles, then you're even better of buying a PS5 in terms of value.

I hope Intel will make a good impact on the gpu market to increase competition and better prices. I'm not too impressed with the gpu market for several years now, the perf/Watt is not as good as the relatively much cheaper cpu market's perf/Watt. Cranking up wattage to get more performance != innovation. I'll wait until '24 to see what Intel's Battlemage is going to bring on the table (so far I'm impressed by the A770, pretty good value (the hardware and features like hevc + av1 encoder) on paper. The only thing what's preventing me to buy one yet is the high power consumption in idle and perf/Watt, otherwise I'd have bought it if the price would be around $/€300-350. I've already read the workaround messing with aspm's powerstates, but that option is not available on my motherboard, plus, I'm running multi monitor setup where that fix does not count and 2 nvme ssd's that rely on pci-e, so messing with the aspm powerstates is not always a smart thing to do.

TL;DR; The gpu market is still messed up and overpriced as of now. When affordable mid-mid high end become available, price/perf and perf/Watt improves above small margins year-on-year, I'll reconsider.

Now, you can buy for €300 a 3050, just to proof my case here what kind of value you get in return (a low end card vs mid range) for 1.5x the price it used to cost several years ago.</p>

<p>The entire gpu market is still a ripoff, while people think it&#39;s a good deal to buy a 2 year dated gpu near a jacked up MSRP on the 2nd hand market is throwing 3x salt in an open wound (as used prices for 2 year old usually is 50% or more depending on the usage and condition). Hell, I even heard and read stories from miners selling their old equipment for the same price they&#39;ve bought them for, so they ran zero losses on investment + profits from mining. It&#39;s pretty self evident here who the winners and losers are.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t control your emotions to buy right now to game AAA titles, then you&#39;re even better of buying a PS5 in terms of value.</p>

<p>I hope Intel will make a good impact on the gpu market to increase competition and better prices. I&#39;m not too impressed with the gpu market for several years now, the perf/Watt is not as good as the relatively much cheaper cpu market&#39;s perf/Watt. Cranking up wattage to get more performance != innovation. I&#39;ll wait until &#39;24 to see what Intel&#39;s Battlemage is going to bring on the table (so far I&#39;m impressed by the A770, pretty good value (the hardware and features like hevc + av1 encoder) on paper. The only thing what&#39;s preventing me to buy one yet is the high power consumption in idle and perf/Watt, otherwise I&#39;d have bought it if the price would be around $/€300-350. I&#39;ve already read the workaround messing with aspm&#39;s powerstates, but that option is not available on my motherboard, plus, I&#39;m running multi monitor setup where that fix does not count and 2 nvme ssd&#39;s that rely on pci-e, so messing with the aspm powerstates is not always a smart thing to do.</p>

<p>TL;DR; The gpu market is still messed up and overpriced as of now. When affordable mid-mid high end become available, price/perf and perf/Watt improves above small margins year-on-year, I&#39;ll reconsider. If the jacked up prices are the new norm, then APU&#39;s/iGPU&#39;s + consoles are possible the way forward and the biggest revenue coming from the consumer masses is then not flowing to nVidia, maybe they don&#39;t care anymore now that they are in the data center and ai business that most likely is way more profitable than this very tiny gaming enthousiast niche and bulk combined, as they still will be profitable is all what matters to the corps to please their shareholders.</p>

If nvidia and amd can stay afloat since they don't need to rely on gpus, does that mean they don't need to budge their increasing prices which at this rate it will never end? I assume they won't lower any 4000 gen card price til next gen late 2024 despite not many people buying the 4070ti in 2023 so far as shown by the availability since they can afford to keep inventory.

Budget gamers who expect 1000 series value won't be getting that anymore in the future. Seems like we're at a point in time and circumstance where sub $200 budget or even mid to high end tier gpus in general aren't worth the company effort, time, money, resources, opportunity cost that could be used somewhere else more profitable.

Once the budget 1600 and 6600 cards are gone they would just keep selling at msrp $300+ gpus in the future. Nvidia and amd would start increasing entry level gpus by a hundred each gen with a $300 4050, $400 5050 and so on until no more gamers feel its worth the money.

I guess if there was value, it was the 1000s, 3080, and amd similar counterparts. If I were to get into gaming, I might just call it a day with 66/700xt or 4070ti since no scalping unfortunately seems like a deal. I get how people say 4070ti is a bad deal $100 more than a 3080 with small performance gains when tech should be getting cheaper for the consumer.

u/Kougar,"Evil? No. Greedy? Maybe. Friends? Nope. It's a gross oversimplification anyway. The XT price didn't have to be a **worse** price/performance ratio than the XTX, but that was AMD's decision. 

I don't think some people realize how odd this situation is. It used to be the lower down the stack you went the better price/perf value models became. This generation suddenly the value gets worse on AMD's side, and it almost doesn't change on NVIDIA's side (4080-4090) because the 4080 is priced so high. At launch day the best case was a 15% performance gain for spending 2x the price on a 3090 over the 3080. That sort of pricing trend was normal behavior. Only now with VRAM capacity becoming an issue is the performance difference widening in some games. 

Frankly I'm more worried AMD will price itself right out of the market regardless of MCM advantages. AMD's market share is floating between 8-15% depending on where you look and despite the even worse value of budget NVIDIA cards AMD reportedly is still losing share. Intel is here to stay and not afraid to offer good value on the low end, so simply existing as the ""not NVIDIA"" option will no longer keep AMD in the market. I haven't even mentioned the ""value"" of the $200 6500XT yet. What little market share they have is going to get eaten alive by Intel if AMD tries another desktop/workstation Navi 24 or more 7900 XT pricing shenanigans to upsell higher models over the next couple years.","<div class=""md""><p>Evil?

u/AncientRaven33,"Yep, that's a very real possibility, although I don't think this will be sustainable for AMD, unless they move to other targets, such as data centers, ai, cloud services, etc., which Nvidia has much better performance in than AMD and I assume most of their 4090's are sold to them rather than gamers.  
From my own experience, I don't know any gamer in real life having bought it, except IT professionals who have the need for CUDA cores.

The difference between work requirements vs gaming needs to be taking in to consideration, as those gpu's are assets when they generate income (whether it was mining or the need for other work that relies on them) vs consuming (i.e. gaming).  
For example, if you mined with a 3090 during the last 6 months of the peak, you'd got your ROI back. Now compare that to a gamer who doesn't make any money from it and upgrades each 2 years => €2000 4090 / 24 months = €83,33 writeoff for the gpu alone and half of that for 4 years. This is very hard to justify for modal income for gamers in even the western world where buying power right now is at levels since the great depression for the first time, whereas it was a good deal for a miner.

We're now in a situation we were in 2008 as well with AMD and Nvidia, which were sued for pricefixing and settled before it went to court. Shortly after, the big crash happened and prices went below MSRP significantly until repriced MSRP for the next gen was over half of previous. The economy is in a similiar situation as in 2008 as well, ironically, with Bern Bernanke recently calling for a soft landing, which they (the banksters) had publically declared as well in dec 2006. We all know what happened.

This also happened with the DDR4 market (pricefixing, until the FSC stepped in and magically prices went down since).

Everything in life happens in cycles, so the high price schemes will not last. I expect no real price decreases (other than discounts on 2x prices is still overpriced) until 2024 (optimistically) and most probably 2025. Intel can stir the pot up heavily with the Battlemage in Q1-Q2 '24 if priced right. Until then, AMD and Nvidia are milking gamers dry.

Even if in the worst case scenario possible, which is highly unlikely, but prices will increasing each gen with $100, then we might see more powerful APU's/iGPU's coming in the low-mid range eventually, because the entire gaming industry would then be severely limited (as a trickle down effect in the medium-long term) so they have to adapt to certain predefined standards to work on, such as console market are right now. This would be bad, because we could end up in a situation where we move to SoC and the freedom to choose parts will then be severely limited (like you have with consoles, nucs or even worse, smarthpones.

Another thing to consider is that there are many people looking for an affordable upgrade. The steam survey proves it, many people are still on a 1060. The many reddit and youtube comments also give indication of this. So even if there are truly good deals, they probably will all sellout before you have a change.

If you're in need right now with budget $250-300, the A750 looks promising if you can stomach the well known issues, otherwise AMD's 6600-6700 and simply nothing from Nvidia (well, you can buy bad perf/price if you want to buy 250-300 low end that is worse than the 200 for the 1060 6gb). If you can wait, then def do, like me.

Personally, I'd not buy second hand (especially mined ones), but I can imagine many budget constraint people might look for this route (be careful what you buy), although prices are still too high even there. I can clearly the see controlled selling there not to dump prices by miners (selling several cards at once with hundreds of reviews in the last months selling their inventory) below the usual 33-50% of msrp on 2 year old gpu's. Also, I ethically oppose buying from miners.  
It's best to wait for next gen and then buy 4000/7000 series if you go this second hand route, to not buy a mined dud and probably have better 2nd hand prices as well.  


TL;DR; If you're budget restraint, wait 1-2 years. If you can't and want to upgrade in 2 years, then buy the cheapest available thing that will serve you, because for 300, you can't buy a ps5 either or limit the games you're playing (instead of AAA games, maybe games like Rimworld or Hearts of Iron IV or even Company of Heroes 3, being released today, doesn't require that much).

The 3060 will compete with the ps5 and can be had for 359: https://www.newegg.com/p/1FT-00EY-00009?Item=9SIBF3CJ4W3816&Source=socialshare&cm_mmc=snc-social-_-sr-_-9SIBF3CJ4W3816-_-02172023

They go on special occasionally as well. That leaves 150-250 for the rest of the machine. 

So 89 for a motherboard:

Check this out on @Newegg: https://www.newegg.com/asrock-b550m-phantom-gaming-4/p/N82E16813157966?Item=N82E16813157966&Source=socialshare&cm_mmc=snc-social-_-sr-_-13-157-966-_-02172023

I’ve used a version of this in the past, it’s a good reliable if not the most feature rich board.

Ryzen 5500: https://www.newegg.com/amd-ryzen-5-5500-ryzen-5-5000-series/p/N82E16819113737?Item=N82E16819113737&Source=socialshare&cm_mmc=snc-social-_-sr-_-19-113-737-_-02172023

94 bucks.

Ram: https://www.newegg.com/corsair-8gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820236674?Item=9SIB8PYJEA6043&Source=socialshare&cm_mmc=snc-social-_-sr-_-9SIB8PYJEA6043-_-02172023

X2, 60 bucks, ddr4 3600 16 gigs.

And that’s off Newegg. I’m sure if I searched for better deals I could put together the whole system case and all for under the budget. It you have a computer already then this will with the parts you already have match the ps5, and if it doesn’t the 3060ti is only a few bucks more:

Building a machine with used parts gets even better here is a refurbished card for 295:

If all I put in the system that’s used is a refurbished graphics card that brings my space up enough to get an ssd or a case and power supply (not a great case or power supply mind you but still..) we aren’t talking thousands of dollars to meet or beat the performance of the ps5. 

Again I’m not saying pcs are better or worse, just killing the myth that you need several grand to beat a console.","<div class=""md""><p>I’m not saying pc is better, just saying it’s a misconception to say that pcs cost more. Even if you discount the fact that most people have a pc and thus are likely a few upgrades away from a console or better than console experience a pc can be built with new pieces for 500-600 bucks that will perform just as well as a ps 5. </p>

<p>The 3060 will compete with the ps5 and can be had for 359: <a href=""https://www.newegg.com/p/1FT-00EY-00009?Item=9SIBF3CJ4W3816&amp;Source=socialshare&amp;cm_mmc=snc-social-_-sr-_-9SIBF3CJ4W3816-_-02172023"">https://www.newegg.com/p/1FT-00EY-00009?Item=9SIBF3CJ4W3816&amp;Source=socialshare&amp;cm_mmc=snc-social-_-sr-_-9SIBF3CJ4W3816-_-02172023</a></p>

<p>They go on special occasionally as well. That leaves 150-250 for the rest of the machine. </p>

<p>So 89 for a motherboard:</p>

<p>I’ve used a version of this in the past, it’s a good reliable if not the most feature rich board.</p>

<p>X2, 60 bucks, ddr4 3600 16 gigs.</p>

<p>And that’s off Newegg. I’m sure if I searched for better deals I could put together the whole system case and all for under the budget. It you have a computer already then this will with the parts you already have match the ps5, and if it doesn’t the 3060ti is only a few bucks more:</p>

u/JonWood007,"Youre putting words in my mouth. I think $220ish is a fair price for a 6600. 

My big issue is that the 6400 and 6500 XT SUCK yet are still $150-200. 

The 6400 should be like $100, and a card like the 6500 XT should be like $130. And then there should be another card between a 6500 XT and a 6600 (say, 3050 level) that costs around $170ish. 

Also, a 16% margin is A LOT as I just demonstrated, the article said that 5% is a low margin, 10% is a ""healthy"" margin, and 20 is ""high.""

They're making good money and can afford to lower prices at 16%. 

Also, I'll tell you why they dont offer a $100 product any more, it's because there's no incentive. 

My first GPU ever was a HD 3650. I'd classify that as roughly a modern equivalent of like....a modern 6500 XT give or take, given they had the 3450 which was even lower tier.

The 3650 was a $75 card. I spent $80 on it. Plugging in the MSRP into an inflation calculator, I get $104. 

Yeah, they can probably make $100 cards, they just choose not to. Because the market is broken.

As I said, the minimum I'd recommend getting is the 6500 XT or 1650 for $170, and I'd personally recommend a 6600 or 6650 XT which get 3060 type performance for significantly less. 

It's only nvidia who has such insane GPU prices. The 6650 XT and Arc A750 both run circles around the 3050 for the most part. 

The thing is, this sub is horribly out of touch with what it considers budget. This is because it's a bunch of upper class white collar professionals who make $75k+ a year doing programming and web development, and graphic design, and often have tons of money to burn. 

So they buy these grossly overpriced GPUs, play at 4k, and think not playing at max settings with ray tracing is unacceptable.

And then they look at us normal 1080p gamers still getting by on mid 5 figure household income and buying $250 GPUs LIKE WE ALWAYS DID as if we are the poors. 

And looking at your attitude, you're just about as bad as the stereotype i pointed out. 

And btw, Im not saying that this level of performance is acceptable for the price either. Quite frankly given how the 6600, Arc A750, and 6650 XT perform for around $250, the prices on the lower cards are WAAAY out of whack.

If we had the same price/performance down the stack, the 1650/6500 XT would be closer to $125-150, the 6400 should be $100, the 1630 would be $75 (seriously, it's on par with the 1050 I mentioned that started at $110), and the 1030 should be like a $40 card. 

The fact that so little progress has happened in 6 years is concerning, and I fear for the TRUE budget segment (which I'd define as around $150 for ""serious"" gamers, those are your traditional ""50"" series buyers). 

But seriously, $250 is your normal middle of the road ""60"" buyers before nvidia decided ""lol, let's charge $350-400"". 

And at this point, given where the market is right now, yeah, this is an NVIDIA problem. Both Intel and AMD have solid offerings for $250. a 6600 will run any game out there at 60 FPS at 1080p on AT LEAST medium, and most on high, if not ultra. It's really the crazy new 2023 releases that make me say ""medium"" given hardware requirements are inflating at a startling rate, but yeah. 

This isn't abnormal for typical midrange buyers though. I traditionally gamed at 900p on like medium-high with your typical $250 card and held onto it for about 5 years on average (4-6 is the typical GPU lifespan). I only went up to 1080p with the 1060. 

And now for some reason rich guys on this sub think that that's minimum and budget and for the poors. No, you guys are just out of touch. 1080p is the most popular monitor size, 720p is probably more popular than 4k in practice, most people game at 60 hz. Etc.

Technically PCs do cost more. No PC part is sold at a loss while consoles are.

Maybe you can cheap out on some things like an HDD rather than a TB M2, get rid of wifi, weaker PSU (most of the times this translates into not reliable for more than a year if stable at all under high consumption) and still have a more powerful machine.

u/bondjavel,"I’m late, but on top of what has already been mentioned, you’re missing some other things here. 

When using Quality/Resolution mode (whatever they’re called), Series S targets up to 1440p60 while Series X and PS5 alike aim for native 2160p30 or 2160p60 with checkerboard rendering. On current and future gen games. The Series S features 10GB of VRAM, while Series X and PS5 feature 16G. They ALL additionally support raytracing on aforementioned resolutions at aforementioned framerates. All on a small form factor and while running on a measly 500 watts during gaming sessions. 

If you’re into VR, having a PS5 also makes it possible to get PSVR2, which provides some of the most immersive VR gaming in the consumer market at some of the most affordable prices. It even competes with the upcoming Quest 3, which is insane. 


You don’t get this stuff on equivalently priced PCs, even when they’re homebuilt on used components. Consoles have won when it comes to bang-for-your-buck gaming, and it will likely stay that way.

<p>When using Quality/Resolution mode (whatever they’re called), Series S targets up to 1440p60 while Series X and PS5 alike aim for native 2160p30 or 2160p60 with checkerboard rendering. On current and future gen games. The Series S features 10GB of VRAM, while Series X and PS5 feature 16G. They ALL additionally support raytracing on aforementioned resolutions at aforementioned framerates. All on a small form factor and while running on a measly 500 watts during gaming sessions. </p>

<p>If you’re into VR, having a PS5 also makes it possible to get PSVR2, which provides some of the most immersive VR gaming in the consumer market at some of the most affordable prices. It even competes with the upcoming Quest 3, which is insane. </p>

And flat costs are universal to any GPU, so the cheaper the product the less money can be put into the die, VRAM, etc. They'd need to be making about a 40% margin right now to get a 6400 from 140 to 100. I don't think they're making 2.5x their overall margin on their *cheapest* GPU.

Most inflation is actually driven by corporate greed.

It's econ 101. Supply and demand, Demand is down. And rather than cut prices, they're cutting supply, to try to make GPUs more scarce, to keep the prices higher. It's scummy. Nvidia is screwing you over, dude.

As I said, this is political, you're right wing.

Cry me a river about how poor people can't afford them to play their games for which they oldy have lots of free time while scavenging for resources in their own poverty. Save the bullshit. We're not talking about cheap used cars for commuting to work. We're talking bout the video card equivalent of high end sports cars. 

Ah yes, the poors shouldnt have access to GPUs. They should just work harder. Only true hard working upper class americans deserve those GPUs. 

You know how delusional you sound when i cut through the ideological bullcrap? Jesus christ this is why i crap on this sub's demographics so much. 

>I'm not a right winger. I've not expressed my specific political views. But you would think so because by your own admission, your ideology clouds your judgment. Way to show your ass by calling me something I'm not.

Given your assumptions on things like inflation, attacking people who disagree with you as leftists, and what you said comparing GPUs to sports cars...yeah I have some bad news for you, buddy...

>No one is forced to buy. Thus one can't be screwed. This is basic logic.

Then you go without. Hooray for pricing people out of the market!

Really, market fundamentalism is a cancer here.

>And none of that mattera because you don't know what's really going on. You know. Your view being shaped by your political ideology..

So is yours. At least im honest and admit it, and wish we could have this conversation on this sub more often. Sorry you dont like having your views challenged.

EDIT: LMFAO he blocked me, my response:

> The ONLY way inflation happens is via government injecting money into the economy. Our currency is centrally managed. This is not disputable.

Yes it is, but that's an extremely simplistic way to look at it. Things also matter like unemployment rate, supply shortages, corporate greed, etc. We just shut down and reopened the entire world economy for a year. The entire WORLD is experiencing inflation. Doing that shocks the entire world economy dude. It's not like a computer. if your computer screws up, turning it off and on again often fixes it. Do that to an economy and it screws it up, because its a complex well managed machine and turning it off and on again knocks the variables out of whack. 

>I never said they should not. I'm saying your dumbass stance on the issue is as of it's like a fundamental good for life and prosperity. It's not and neither are video games. So frame me out to be anti-poor, because that's what people like you do. You delude yourself that because you're poor and can't afford a new high end GPU, that the problem is everything else but you. It's childish and shallow.

Hint, it's not just the ""high end"", it's the entire market. Historically, GPUs ranged from around $100 up to around $500-700. Heck going all the way back to the 2000s was wild as I remember GPUs down as low as like $50. 

The 1650 is freaking $170, and it's 4 years old. ""60"" cards went from costing $200-300 up to $350-400. That's the ""bread and butter"" GPU. Im not talking that enthusiast crap. The cheapest ""current gen"" card is the ""$250"" (reallty $300) 3050. And in 6 years we've only seen about a 50% increase in performance epr dollar, with 2/3 of that happening 4 years ago with the 16 series. 

The entire budget GPU market is more or less GONE. $150-180 is entry level now. That's your RX 6400s and 1650s. And if not for AMD, we old 1060 and 580 owners would LITERALLY HAVE NO UPGRADE PATH. Youre in your own little world going on about ""luxury GPUs"" and sports cars and blah blah blah.

here I'm seeing people priced out of the market entirely. Theres a reason the 1060 is still one of the top cards on steam hardware survey. And the 1650...replaced it? That's WORSE! Seriously, how do you not understand that this market is just BROKEN? Full on broken.

So yeah I am gonna crap on your views here since it really does seem to reek of the typical elitism I see on these hardware subs. About 5-10 years ago it used to be full of people looking to typically spend $500-1000 on a computer. An ENTIRE COMPUTER.

Your typical PC 10 years ago was like a i5 2500k with a 760 or something. And people were still buying FX CPUs and i3s and mixing them when 750 tis and stuff. 

Again, these people are being full on PRICED OUT of the market. That's BAD. Well, unless you're a snotty elitist who doesnt care about affordable PC gaming, which sounds like half this sub sometimes. 

>That's exactly what it is right? You're broke so you're mad and blame them for being anti-poor and gatekeeping you. What an insanely narcissistic view. Guess what. They don't give a shit about your economic status. If they can get you to buy, and your market segment profitable enough, then you'll have an option.

Ah yes, more poor shaming. And yes, by your standard i AM poor. And apparently i dont deserve to game and should work harder or some crap. 

Again, you might not like having your views challenged, but you're an economic right winger. 

>You've done literally nothing to challenge me. You were easily baited into revealing your far left bias and it's obvious you were triggered. You're triggered because you felt personally slighted. Classic narcissistic toxic left wing bullshit. You can't handle that I exist on here so you feel the need to attack me personally. It's pathetic and does your ideology no favors.

Hint, you dont need to bait me to show my bias. I wear it on my sleeve. Anyone who checks my profile can see Im fairly left wing. At least by capitalist standards. The amount of gatekeeping i get from actual anti capitalist leftists is astounding. But yeah, according to you, the mere suggestion that markets should work for the people and we shouldnt have to spend $300 on an entry level bottom of the barrel GPU apparently makes me a pinko commie. 

I really couldnt give a crap what someone of your ideological persuasion thinks of me, because i quite frankly stopped giving a crap what the ""right"" thinks about, well...anything any more. 

But yeah, you ARE right wing, whether you'll admit it or not. As is most of this sub. And that bias is insufferable on here sometimes. As i said, bunch of upper class yuppies out of touch with the rest of the country, and the world while we're at it.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

<p>So yeah I am gonna crap on your views here since it really does seem to reek of the typical elitism I see on these hardware subs. About 5-10 years ago it used to be full of people looking to typically spend $500-1000 on a computer. An ENTIRE COMPUTER.</p>

<p>Your typical PC 10 years ago was like a i5 2500k with a 760 or something. And people were still buying FX CPUs and i3s and mixing them when 750 tis and stuff. </p>

<p>Again, these people are being full on PRICED OUT of the market. That&#39;s BAD. Well, unless you&#39;re a snotty elitist who doesnt care about affordable PC gaming, which sounds like half this sub sometimes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s exactly what it is right? You&#39;re broke so you&#39;re mad and blame them for being anti-poor and gatekeeping you. What an insanely narcissistic view. Guess what. They don&#39;t give a shit about your economic status. If they can get you to buy, and your market segment profitable enough, then you&#39;ll have an option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah yes, more poor shaming. And yes, by your standard i AM poor. And apparently i dont deserve to game and should work harder or some crap. </p>

<p>Again, you might not like having your views challenged, but you&#39;re an economic right winger. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve done literally nothing to challenge me. You were easily baited into revealing your far left bias and it&#39;s obvious you were triggered. You&#39;re triggered because you felt personally slighted. Classic narcissistic toxic left wing bullshit. You can&#39;t handle that I exist on here so you feel the need to attack me personally. It&#39;s pathetic and does your ideology no favors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint, you dont need to bait me to show my bias. I wear it on my sleeve. Anyone who checks my profile can see Im fairly left wing. At least by capitalist standards. The amount of gatekeeping i get from actual anti capitalist leftists is astounding. But yeah, according to you, the mere suggestion that markets should work for the people and we shouldnt have to spend $300 on an entry level bottom of the barrel GPU apparently makes me a pinko commie. </p>

<p>I really couldnt give a crap what someone of your ideological persuasion thinks of me, because i quite frankly stopped giving a crap what the &quot;right&quot; thinks about, well...anything any more. </p>

<p>But yeah, you ARE right wing, whether you&#39;ll admit it or not. As is most of this sub. And that bias is insufferable on here sometimes. As i said, bunch of upper class yuppies out of touch with the rest of the country, and the world while we&#39;re at it.</p>

u/executordestroyer,"With prices now, a pc makes sense in a purely gaming use not including having the functionality of a desktop. But I'm on the fence whether buying a console at launch makes sense compared to a pc upgrade back in 2020 when people manage to get it at msrp.

I don't remember how expensive but was upgrading back in 2020-2021 still the better choice than console? iirc every gpu was double price and console fared no better.

The problem isn't whether or not to buy a house. The problem is, you seem to just casually expect people to be able to save one-third of their income each year.

When the problem is that housing prices are unjustifiably too high.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>
