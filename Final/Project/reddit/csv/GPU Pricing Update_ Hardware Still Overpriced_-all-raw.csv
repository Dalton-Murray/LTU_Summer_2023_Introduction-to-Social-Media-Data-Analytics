nah, prices weren't that cheap even back in let's say the maxwell days, let alone the kepler days.  GK110 cutdowns launched for $999, which is now $1274, full GK104 launched at $499 which is now $637.  And people often ran two of those cards!  And also CPI doesn't describe computer hardware and the inflation has been higher there than elsewhere due to spiraling costs and lackluster shrinks from newer nodes.

people are just making up fantasy prices.  actually GPUs are 27x more expensive than they really should be!!!!!

the ""good scenario"" is GPU prices dropping like 20%.  Prices aren't going to drop 50-70%, get fucking real, that's just wishful thinking.

Everyone including NVIDIA and AMD wish they could do that, nobody is *excited* about mediocre generations, everyone wishes they could introduce a product that would make your old shit obsolete every year so they could sell you a new one.  But it's just not going to be possible without some fundamental breakthrough in silicon that brings back the glory days of moore's law.

Doesn't mean it's worth upgrading every year, we are now in the CPU-style model where a good GPU can easily carry you for 5 years and that's a good thing for the planet overall.  But crying doesn't change the physics involved - there is some gouging for sure but it's like 10-20%, not the 70%+ reductions that some people are demanding.

60 card = $250

70 card = $380

80 card = $500

That's how it used to work. That's how it ALWAYS used to work. And every generation, we would see healthy gains in price/performance. Sometimes 20-30% during a refresh generation, but sometimes up to double. 

In 2016 you could buy a 480 or 1060 for $250ish. In 2019, we only got a 1660 Ti to replace that roughly, which was a measly 35% improvement. Sure, the 2060 came out, but they wanted $350 for the thing, which was ridiculous. But after 3 years, you'd think we'd get something like that for $250. We didn't. 

Then nvidia did the same thing with the 3060, charged $330 for it and people acted like they were doing us a favor. I dont care what happens in $800 land, because no one should pay that much for GPUs in the first place unless you're some insane enthusiast. 

Either way, yeah, the 1080 ti was $700. And anything above that is a scam. 

But yeah. Going back to my 1060 comparison, in 2021or 2022, i forget when it came out, but we got the 3050 for $250. It was just as 1660 ti with ray tracing. More stagnation. 4000 series, more price hikes, more stagnation. Performance per dollar only improved 50% on the nvidia side. IN SIX YEARS. That's insane. Historically before than we saw a doubling in performance every 3. For reference, the 2500k to the 7600k was also 50%, so we're at intel stagnation levels of price/performance. 

It gets even worse down the stack. 2016 the 1050 ti was $140 MSRP and when i bought sold for around $180. Nowadays, you get a 1650 at that price range, a card that came out in 2018 and was only around 25% better than a 1050 ti. 1660 ti is around $230. In 2018 it was the 1660 and in 2016 it was the 1060 3 GB. Another paltry performance gain. 1070 in 2016. We got the 2060 in 2018. Then the 3060 and 3060 Ti in 2020/2021. More measly 50% gains roughly.

You get the idea. I couldnt care less about die sizes and OMG this is GA102, this is 104, blah blah blah. DOnt care. I care about ""what performance can i get for the money"", and honestly this level of stagnation is so bad it should be triggering anti trust investigations into the GPU market. Because something is fundamentally unhealthy here.

In order to double my last card, i needed to buy AMD, because AMD for some reason is selling their GPUs a whole tier of price lower than nvidia, which is what everyone should've been doing in the first place.

if you want to know what i think GPU pricing would be fair, I'd say, take the cheapest RDNA2 cards over the past 3 months and about that.

6600s for around $200 is fair. 6650 XTs for $250-300 is fair. 6700 XTs for $350-400 is fair. 6800s for around $500 is fair. 6950 XTs for $700 is fair. That's what the market should've looked like all along. Heck i just wish we had some serious budget options too. 6500 XT is a massive gap in performance down for not a lot less money. And the 6400 is just pathetic. 6500 XT should be like $120ish and the 6400 should be sub $100 IMO.

In reality, the first 80 tier card as we now know them, the GTX 280, was launched at $649, and that was back in 2008. Corrected for inflation, that would be almost $900 today. Extremely high competition from AMD's 4000 series forced Nvidia to drop the price down to $499 (and, even at $499, it was still $200 more than the highly competitive HD4870).

&#x200B;

>And every generation, we would see healthy gains in price/performance. Sometimes 20-30% during a refresh generation, but sometimes up to double.

And 1st wave Ampere also brought that, which was my original point. 3080/70 had double the performance-per-dollar than 2080/Ti cards.

&#x200B;

>But after 3 years, you'd think we'd get something like that for $250. We didn't.

Turing had the 16-series GPUs to cover this price range, as you've already mentioned. While Ampere has the RTX 3050 at this price range. If we factor inflation, the RTX 3050 is actually cheaper than the GTX 1060 was.

&#x200B;

>Then nvidia did the same thing with the 3060, charged $330 for it and people acted like they were doing us a favor.

I never saw anyone say this. The RTX 3060 came after the 3060 Ti, and, if anything, it always regarded as terrible value, given the 3060 Ti offered over 33% more performance for 20% more money. If anything, the 3060 kickstarted Ampere's second-wave of cards - those that offered progressively worse performance-per-dollar. 1st-wave Ampere (3070, 3080 and 3060 Ti - not 3090 for obvious reasons) was the last time the market see Nvidia launch truly compelling products.

&#x200B;

>Either way, yeah, the 1080 ti was $700. And anything above that is a scam.

As was the 3080.

&#x200B;

>Performance per dollar only improved 50% on the nvidia side. IN SIX YEARS. That's insane. Historically before than we saw a doubling in performance every 3.

That's because performance per dollar has been stagnant since the 3080 was launched, back in 2020.

&#x200B;

>For reference, the 2500k to the 7600k was also 50%, so we're at intel stagnation levels of price/performance.

CPUs can't scale like GPUs because CPU workloads are highly sequential, as opposed to graphics which are tremendously parallel workloads. It's easier to scale compute units than it is to make those compute units faster, this is why GPUs improve faster than CPUs.

&#x200B;

>We got the 2060 in 2018. Then the 3060 and 3060 Ti in 2020/2021. More measly 50% gains roughly.

The 3060 Ti was a **great** GPU. It was brutally faster than **anything** priced below it, and it delivered performance over the $699 2080 Super... for $399. If you want to compare it with Pascal, it offered nearly double the performance of the 1070 which shared the same MSRP. Plus, you had DLSS and RT. So, in just two generations, the 3060 Ti was offering twice the performance per dollar (even more if you adjust for inflation), plus DLSS and RT support.

The 3060 Ti still has no genuine substitute. And, if the 40 series leaks are anything to be taken seriously, it might seem that 40 series will never spawn a genuine replacement for the 3060 Ti.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

<p>I never saw anyone say this. The RTX 3060 came after the 3060 Ti, and, if anything, it always regarded as terrible value, given the 3060 Ti offered over 33% more performance for 20% more money. If anything, the 3060 kickstarted Ampere&#39;s second-wave of cards - those that offered progressively worse performance-per-dollar. 1st-wave Ampere (3070, 3080 and 3060 Ti - not 3090 for obvious reasons) was the last time the market see Nvidia launch truly compelling products.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either way, yeah, the 1080 ti was $700. And anything above that is a scam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As was the 3080.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Performance per dollar only improved 50% on the nvidia side. IN SIX YEARS. That&#39;s insane. Historically before than we saw a doubling in performance every 3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because performance per dollar has been stagnant since the 3080 was launched, back in 2020.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For reference, the 2500k to the 7600k was also 50%, so we&#39;re at intel stagnation levels of price/performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CPUs can&#39;t scale like GPUs because CPU workloads are highly sequential, as opposed to graphics which are tremendously parallel workloads. It&#39;s easier to scale compute units than it is to make those compute units faster, this is why GPUs improve faster than CPUs.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We got the 2060 in 2018. Then the 3060 and 3060 Ti in 2020/2021. More measly 50% gains roughly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 3060 Ti was a <strong>great</strong> GPU. It was brutally faster than <strong>anything</strong> priced below it, and it delivered performance over the $699 2080 Super... for $399. If you want to compare it with Pascal, it offered nearly double the performance of the 1070 which shared the same MSRP. Plus, you had DLSS and RT. So, in just two generations, the 3060 Ti was offering twice the performance per dollar (even more if you adjust for inflation), plus DLSS and RT support.</p>

<p>The 3060 Ti still has no genuine substitute. And, if the 40 series leaks are anything to be taken seriously, it might seem that 40 series will never spawn a genuine replacement for the 3060 Ti.</p>

You got the numbers right for the 3080 and 2080 Ti. Not for the 1080 and 2080. The 2080 had 46/48 SMs and the 1080 had a fully enabled GP104 (20/20 SMs).

>So the 3080 is roughly halfway between a 2080 and 2080 Ti in terms of SM count compared to the full die.

That's misleading, to say the least. The 3080 performs within 90% of a 3090, which features a nearly full GA102 and operates at comparable power levels. I'll take the 3090 Ti out of the equation because the 3090 Ti relies most of its performance uplift on the massive 450W TDP (which, in real-world testing, is closer to 480W for the reference FE model) rather than any actual architectural upgrades (it's only got 2 more SMs than the 3090). If you feed 3080s and 3090s with the same 480W (which isn't a far-fetched idea, given all those cards are based off the exact same die; if a 3090 Ti chip can take 480W, so can any other GA102 chip), most of the performance advantage of the 3090 Ti will be gone.

Unlike the 3080, the 2080 and 1080 performed nowhere near the bigger models. Even with partially disabled chips, the 1080 Ti and 2080 Ti brutally outperformed their 104 siblings. The 1080 Ti was, in average, 35% faster than the 1080 at 4K. Meanwhile, the 2080 Ti still outperformed the 2080 by nearly 30%, and that's considering that, at the stock 250W TDP, it operated nearly 300Mhz below the 2080. As a reference, the 2080 had a 215W TDP. In other words, it had 67% the SMs but 86% the TDP. This is why so many AIB 2080 Tis would operate over 300W, which allowed them to operate at similar clock speeds to 2080 cards; even overclocked 2080s. The TU102 had no problems operating as fast as the TU104, as long as it had comparable power per SM (and adequate cooling to boot). Once you adjusted the cards to operate at similar clockspeeds, the 2080 Ti opened an even bigger performance advantage over the 2080.

The bottom line here is that, in the end of the day, what really matters is what chip your GPU has. Obviously, a full version of a chip will perform better than a partially disabled chip. However, the truth of the fact is that all cards that feature a same chip will perform relatively close to each other, just look at the 3080 and 3090 and how close they are to each other. Similarly, the 3060 Ti offers near-to-3070 levels of performance, and this comes ate no surprise as it features the same chip. Now, step down to the 3060 and there's a massive performance drop, they're nowhere near in performance. And that's easily explained by the 3060 using a lower tier chip. Of course, there are some exceptions, like the first GA106-powered RTX 3050s. In essence, because the GA107s weren't ready available at the time, the first 3050s to hit the market featured the GA106 instead of the GA107 which should have equipped it since the beginning. Reducing the GA106 to GA107 levels means the chip is massively capped at 2/3 its capacity. Obviously, this type of decision only serves as a temporary solution, given it makes no financial sense to commercialize chips at such reduced capacities. As a reference, the smallest GA102 - the 3080, still features a full fat 20 SMs more than a fully enabled GA104.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Extremely high competition from AMD's 4000 series forced Nvidia to drop the price down to $499 (and, even at $499, it was still $200 more than the highly competitive HD4870).

Yes I know that and they were ####ing overpriced too. 

Hence why everyone lauds AMD for releasing the 4000 and 5000 series cards at sane prices and driving the prices down. 

This is just ""well ackshully"" counter factuals ignoring the fact that the launch prices of the 200 series were insane and nvidia got punished for doing it effectively.

Cool for rich people, does nothing for the sub $400 segment.

Cool, except it was exactly $400, which was way too expensive for a 60 series card, and keep in mind, does nothing for any of us in the sub $400 market.

I dont care how great these cards were for rich people. Im a normal person who buys $200-300 GPUs. Your arguments do not connect with me at all. Because I see it as ""1060 -> 1660 ti/super -> 3050"". That's a HORRID improvement in 6 years. 

>As was the 3080.

yeah and 80 cards normally go for $500-600.

Besides youre missing the point that now there are literally three tiers of card above that and we're a whole tier lower than 2017.

>That's because performance per dollar has been stagnant since the 3080 was launched, back in 2020.

it's been stagnant for far longer if you're NOT in the $800 segment. JESUS.

>CPUs can't scale like GPUs because CPU workloads are highly sequential, as opposed to graphics which are tremendously parallel workloads. It's easier to scale compute units than it is to make those compute units faster, this is why GPUs improve faster than CPUs.

Jesus christ you're dense.

Way to miss the point.

>The 3060 Ti was a great GPU. It was brutally faster than anything priced below it, and it delivered performance over the $699 2080 Super... for $399. If you want to compare it with Pascal, it offered nearly double the performance of the 1070 which shared the same MSRP. Plus, you had DLSS and RT. So, in just two generations, the 3060 Ti was offering twice the performance per dollar (even more if you adjust for inflation), plus DLSS and RT support.

Cool, except it LITERALLY DOES NOTHING FOR THOSE OF US WITH 1060S.

Jesus christ you're dense. It's like you're literally the ""well ackshully"" guy. Like holy ####, touch grass. Seriously. 

I ain't doing this any more. You are clueless.

If you wanna look at what i consider good pricing, look at the AMD side of things. I literally bought a 6650 XT, which is almost on par with your lauded 3060 Ti for **$230**. That's a deal. Nvidia is price gauging. The only decently priced cards for what they offer right now are the AMD 6000 series.

https://imgur.com/MnZF6q1

Seriously, I got my deal at $1.78 according to that chart. THAT'S a deal. Even your 3060 Ti is still a worse value than almost the entirety of AMD's offerings right now. Only flagship cards are a worse value.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>
<p>In reality, the first 80 tier card as we now know them, the GTX 280, was launched at $649, and that was back in 2008. Corrected for inflation, that would be almost $900 today. Extremely high competition from AMD&#39;s 4000 series forced Nvidia to drop the price down to $499 (and, even at $499, it was still $200 more than the highly competitive HD4870).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I know that and they were ####ing overpriced too. </p>

<p>Hence why everyone lauds AMD for releasing the 4000 and 5000 series cards at sane prices and driving the prices down. </p>

<p>This is just &quot;well ackshully&quot; counter factuals ignoring the fact that the launch prices of the 200 series were insane and nvidia got punished for doing it effectively. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And 1st wave Ampere also brought that, which was my original point. 3080/70 had double the performance-per-dollar than 2080/Ti cards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cool for rich people, does nothing for the sub $400 segment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turing had the 16-series GPUs to cover this price range, as you&#39;ve already mentioned. While Ampere has the RTX 3050 at this price range. If we factor inflation, the RTX 3050 is actually cheaper than the GTX 1060 was.</p>
