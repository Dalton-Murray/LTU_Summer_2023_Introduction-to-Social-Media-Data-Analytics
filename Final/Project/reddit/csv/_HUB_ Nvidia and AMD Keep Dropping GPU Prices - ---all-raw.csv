u/wizfactor,"It's pretty telling that the new stuff (4060 Ti, 7600) is already being discounted. Graphics cards are not like SSDs and RAM where the price fluctuates like your usual commodity, which means Nvidia and AMD signed off on these price drops to some extent.

We're currently in a state of consumer chip oversupply, so patient gamers can probably expect some more price drops in the short term. However, there are already rumors that Nvidia (no word yet on AMD) is set to reduce production of consumer chips in order to better match the cold demand for graphics cards. That means the discount party is going to end at some point.

How exactly it ends is hard to predict. It could be that prices will raise back up to MSRP once the undersupply meets the under-demand. Personally, I think Nvidia and AMD will just let these discounts stay the way they are and just replace existing SKUs with ""Super"" refreshes. The ""Super"" SKUs will set a brand new MSRP that are more likely to hold due to no longer being oversupplied, and the existing discounted SKUs will eventually sell out.","<div class=""md""><p>It&#39;s pretty telling that the new stuff (4060 Ti, 7600) is already being discounted.

The discount party will continue ad-hoc if sales aren't doing well enough through the holiday. The retail side will not be happy about carrying inventory that isn't selling and supply will be higher during the holiday. If sales aren't good enough exiting the holidays, it doesn't get better over time. Seasonality going through the first half of a year will only see weaker sales.

Nvidia recently said that they're observing upgrade cycles to be about 3-3.5 years. The RTX 3060 was available in late February 2021. So not only are we in a down-cycle due to the inventory glut, we're not yet in the upgrade cycle for last-gen users. 

I agree. I think a mid-gen refresh is likely next year. 

Also, if Nvidia is expecting to grow in the datacenter, it's not only H100/A100 that they'll be selling. The L4 will likely be their top selling inference card, like the T4 was. That means they'll be producing lots of AD104 to bin for the L4.

Somebody will come with a 230-price offer and another with 270 euro but that tends to be it. Sell that same piece of hardware for 400 Euro, and you get maybe a 310 a 330-euro price offer that you can accept.

You need to play with the price to get good lowball offers. Put it like bargain low, yes, it will sell very fast (and people will still lowball you!). But you are taking a big cut on the already secondhand price (especially when you add ebay fees). 

In Germany they now removed ebay fees for private sellers because the platform is like half death. You can tell from the constant lowball offers that are just so ridiculous and the relative low number of buyers. A lot these days there is shops and big commercial sellers.","<div class=""md""><p>They are not slow, they simply look at other people prices, and match those with maybe a small discount.

u/capn_hector,"[As Tim HUB says…](https://youtu.be/ycXkvVfc2yw?t=2583) it’s not to the point yet that you should *only* consider cards with dlss, and it’s probably not worth buying an 8gb card instead of a 12gb (3060 ti / 4060 non ti vs 6700XT) but… it’s a pretty major advantage for nvidia in the 1080p and 1440p segments and it’s supported in all the games that matter. In these cases of tiebreaker it is a pretty big lean in Nvidia’s favor.

[According to HUB’s video on the topic,](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy3ikm8MxOM) the 6950XT is 15% faster at 1440p and that’s significantly less than the amount that DLSS Quality adds (while maintaining roughly native quality output), and FSR2 Quality mode has bad output at 1440p. If you are willing to take the quality loss from using FSR2 quality mode for a 20-30% bump, DLSS2 performance mode will bump the DLSS increase to more like 50% and it utterly blows the 6950XT away at equal visual quality again. That’s the situation AMD finds themselves in competing against DLSS, their cards really need to be delivering around 30% more raw raster to keep up with the image quality loss from FSR2 in the 1080p and 1440p segments given how bad FSR2 is at those resolutions. Dlss2 quality is roughly on par with native (often better, actually), it’s essentially free frames, and FSR2 is **not**, especially at 1080p and 1440p where it’s rather poor.

If you think of upscaling like an op-amp… there is a gain ratio and AMD cards are simply much noisier for a given gain ratio. So they need to be offering a stronger input signal to offset that, because to the end user it doesn’t matter - stronger input vs cleaner gain is an implementation detail, all they care is that it sounds the same. And nvidia has got it to the point where their first setting of gain doesn't add any noise, and if you don’t want the gain you can choose DLAA and get cleaner-than-native output for free instead. That’s the marketing problem AMD faces in the 1080p and 1440p segments. Also, all of this applies to intel as well, their XeSS is much closer to DLSS2 than FSR2, AMD is significantly behind *both* competitors.

Let alone any kind of perf/w comparison…. 6950XT consumes 200W more power to get that 15% native res win, and cost 5% more, at the time of their video (it’s gone up a bit more since as stock depletes).  And DLSS doesn't really increase the card power, the TDP budget is what it is and the framerate is what it is.  It's a cheap way to render more frames per watt and more frames period.  Laptop dGPU is a dying segment but DLSS is absolutely a must-have if you are buying a gaming laptop imo.  Ada is pushing like 2x the native perf/w of RDNA2, and with DLSS piled in that rises to like, 250-300% of the perf/w of RDNA2 dGPUs.

Yes, the 6950XT has 4GB more but the 4070 isn’t up against the wall in the same way the 8gb cards are. Series S has 8GB of VRAM and series X has 10GB, so, it’s probably not going to massively massively increase such that 12gb is unplayable.

It’s arguable but at equal price the balance really does tip towards the 4070, even Steve is onboard with that one. If you can get a 6800XT for $450 or $500 then whatever but the era of paying $600-700 for Navi 21 is really drawing to a close. Giving up DLSS and/or suffering through FSR2 1440p at 200w more power and 5% higher cost for a 10% performance advantage and 4GB more vram really is not worth it in the big picture.

4070 is a legit decent card, it’s just not a return to Moores law era progress. The 3080 and 3060 ti were the value peak of the lineup and struggled to reach msrp, 4070 being a more efficient 3080 12gb for $100 less really is not bad. With the $100 microcenter steam GC deal it’s actually pretty great, 4070 12gb for de facto $500 is about as good as things are going to get this gen. Yes, not as good a deal as 1070 or 970, but things are different now.","<div class=""md""><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/ycXkvVfc2yw?t=2583"">As Tim HUB says…</a> it’s not to the point yet that you should <em>only</em> consider cards with dlss, and it’s probably not worth buying an 8gb card instead of a 12gb (3060 ti / 4060 non ti vs 6700XT) but… it’s a pretty major advantage for nvidia in the 1080p and 1440p segments and it’s supported in all the games that matter.

u/benjiro3000,"> most stores like Mindfactory don't sell / ship to other Europe countries.

That is mostly a shipping cost and legal issue with scammers. Shipping inside of Germany is dirt cheap with DHL. The moment you cross the border even by one meter, that price really jumps up a lot. 

Now combine that with a very active community of thief's that use stolen PayPal, visa, and other payment methods to buy items. By the time it's get flagged as stolen, the seller is eating that cost because if you want to report the issue, well, good luck dealing with French of Romanian police. I also do not like it but as long as our justice system is so fragmented in Europe, well ...

The issue is also, lets say they ship to Belgium. Maybe they have less problem with scammers there, but if you ship to Belgium, the next guy in Romania can say ""hey, you are discriminating my EU country"" (what technically is correct, it is a form of discrimination and that is against some EU laws of goods sold in EU). So, it became ""We simply ship to nobody"".

My father yeaaaars ago dealt with a Polish seller for some wood stove. He wanted to buy directly from Poland (and pay shipping). They said: ""No, we have a distributor in your country, you need to use him"". 

Except that guy was asking like 50% more for the exact same thing, that this distributor needed to order from ... Poland. Dad fed up (and stubborn as a mule) contacted EU and said, ""hey, they are selling these products across border using a distributor, that means i can order directly from them"". Yep, EU agreed, and Polish shop needed to sell directly. And if you only sell inside your own country, well, EU cannot force you to sell outside your country, but if you have a network or selective sell outside, then you need to sell to ALL EU countries.

So i hope this explains a few things...

> May I ask what do you use to sell / buy used instead of Ebay?

For the bulk is still Ebay, they still have the best buy protection, sell protection is kind of iffy and i always advice people to document EVERYTHING. Your good working, take picture, put them in box, pictures, packaging, pictures, label, pictures... Really helps with issue buyers.

It's just a lot less people then in the past so it takes longer to sell items. 

Part of the issue with affordable hardware is, people simply do not bother selling on eBay and throw stuff in a corner. The high sales tax really hurt selling anything below a X value, as your time/effort vs $$$ became an issue (combine that with thiefs/scammers/karens). So, this is probably one of the reasons eBay removed the tax. Dwindling sales and less people. In other words, i do not think people move to different planforms so much as people simply stopped selling their old stuff and chucked it. I also did this a lot in the last few years. It was not worth the hassle vs the money stuff sold at (after ebay their tax).

A alternative is Kleinanzeigen.de (owned by ebay as they bought up almost every secondhand platform in Europe). It's very, VERY unregulated and even more open for abuse. Burned a few times there. With also a very small buyer/seller group.

Amazon is an alternative for secondhand sales these days but i have no experience with their policies.

So yea, not a lot of choice... Every country has some local 2th hand shops but most are owned by ebay these days.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

<p>Part of the issue with affordable hardware is, people simply do not bother selling on eBay and throw stuff in a corner. The high sales tax really hurt selling anything below a X value, as your time/effort vs $$$ became an issue (combine that with thiefs/scammers/karens). So, this is probably one of the reasons eBay removed the tax. Dwindling sales and less people. In other words, i do not think people move to different planforms so much as people simply stopped selling their old stuff and chucked it. I also did this a lot in the last few years. It was not worth the hassle vs the money stuff sold at (after ebay their tax).</p>

<p>A alternative is Kleinanzeigen.de (owned by ebay as they bought up almost every secondhand platform in Europe). It&#39;s very, VERY unregulated and even more open for abuse. Burned a few times there. With also a very small buyer/seller group.</p>

<p>Amazon is an alternative for secondhand sales these days but i have no experience with their policies.</p>

<p>So yea, not a lot of choice... Every country has some local 2th hand shops but most are owned by ebay these days.</p>

The 6950xt.

If you'd said there's a strong argument for a 4070 over a 6950xt, I wouldn't have bothered commenting. But you saying it ""slays"" it made it sound like it demolishes it, which it certainly doesn't. 

Also many people don't even use upscaling, which your entire argument is based on, and some games (One I play for example is grounded) only have FSR, not DLSS. So it wouldn't matter if DLSS was 1000x better than native, since it doesn't exist in that game.

But even the above point is moot if you don't bother with any upscalers. 

Lastly many of us are not in the US, I'm in the UK, so US prices and micro center deals mean nothing, they're equally priced most places over here.

u/throwaway15454152415,"Hi.

I work in a mgmt retail position for a large company. Some (most of actually) of what you said isn't quite right.

>Now combine that with a very active community of thief's that use stolen PayPal, visa, and other payment methods to buy items. By the time it's get flagged as stolen, the seller is eating that cost because if you want to report the issue, well, good luck dealing with French of Romanian police. I also do not like it but as long as our justice system is so fragmented in Europe, well ...

For paypal this can be true. Chargebacks are a thing, however with many other payment methods including credit card, this isn't so. 
In EU you should explicitly require 3DS as mandated by PSD2 ratification. As such, the risk shifts to the cardholder/bank. You can easily limit payment methods, for certain customers. It's not particularly hard, unheard of or illegal.

>The issue is also, lets say they ship to Belgium. Maybe they have less problem with scammers there, but if you ship to Belgium, the next guy in Romania can say ""hey, you are discriminating my EU country"" (what technically is correct, it is a form of discrimination and that is against some EU laws of goods sold in EU). So, it became ""We simply ship to nobody"".

This is also not true. You can discriminate countries and indeed you do so. Go to amazon.es and try to order a battery operated item to your native country. Chances are you will not be able to due to safety regulations that make sending stuff around more difficult than in-country.

Giving Spain or Portugal as examples. These two countries have islands, some of which do not have airports and the commodities are shipped via boat. Even within these countries it was and is possible to have shipments denied - especially for large appliances. I believe, recently Portugal had a law change that makes it so national delivery must be possible but my memory is fuzzy and cba to google.

In reality, it's very much a business choice. You have to factor in logistical cost, mis-shipments, damages during transport and all the customer support headaches that come from that. Further, now you'd have to probably support different support languages, have your website calculate shipping costs to different regions (more ship vias, perhaps different carriers, different cargo calculations at warehouse/hub/stores/whatever, etc) and then incorporate all of this into your accountancy and forecasting.
Perhaps you'd need to cross-dock somewhere (big appliances often do, due to size), etc. Dropshipping now becomes an issue as it must cross-dock in your facilities if the supplier can't deliver there, effectively transforming these items into long tail items - once again adding risk/cost to you since now you're responsible for everything and not the supplier as well as making the lead time longer...

In sum, all of this is added complexity and at the end of the day it's just a decision of cost vs net margin vs growth and I'd say for this company the numbers just aren't there to justify all of this hassle. I could go on for hours on this. There's a lot more stuff to do when selling EU-wide than just worrying about payments and frauds...","<div class=""md""><p>Hi.</p>

The 4090 has the worst performance/$ at all resolutions (ok technically the 6500 xt is worse at 4k, but that's not a usable card at that resolution) of any card you can buy.

The real point is that previously the '90 card was a big price hike over a slightly slower card, and now it's a big price hike over a significantly slower card.

This is not an improvement lol, they just won't sell you a great product for less than $1600 now, whereas previously they would.

E.g. 3080 for $699 vs the 3090 for $999. The 3080 saved you 30% and was 12% slower. The 4080 is is 21% slower for 25% less. That's not a very compelling price difference.

u/capn_hector,"4070 got slammed by the (a) x70 is supposed to be $329 forever! bandwagon (because of the one singular time they dropped it that low), and (b) general hate bandwagon around Ada.

4080 and 4060 Ti are unsalvageable at their current pricing, and 4070 Ti and 4060 16GB will be mediocre, but 4070 is actually a solid card at a solid price and has *enough* VRAM, although 16GB would have been nicer at that price (I understand the hardware reasons ofc).  4060 8GB and 4070 really are both great cards given the way node costs/etc have risen.

But x70 is such a popular segment and everybody loves the 970, and remembers the fake non-FE MSRP that nobody followed for the 1070.  And everyone is just so primed for ""new cards are bad, don't buy"" that even actual good deals just don't penetrate the hivemind.  It drove me nuts that people didn't think the microcenter deal (effectively $500 for a 4070) was even very good, like that was just ""ok"" to people.  That was actually an amazing deal and the alternative is going to be shit like the 4060 Ti 16GB.  People aren't going to like whatever Navi 32 product AMD farts out at that price segment either.

People also love to do comparisons against the 3060 Ti MSRP which was literally never at MSRP until like a month ago, or mix and match the 3080 10GB (cheaper, smaller VRAM) against the 3080 12GB (no official MSRP), and the 4070 really is the best of both worlds and also $100 cheaper.  Same for 4060/Ti, people start compare against the 3070 performance and mixing that with the 3060 Ti price and then whining that it doesn't stack a bunch of additional improvement on top of that.  4060 Ti is still mediocre but 4060 being 3060 Ti perf for $300 is really pretty great actually, you're 25% cheaper than the very best card in the 30-series lineup that literally never hit MSRP until like two months ago because it was too damn cheap for partners to want to make it.

FWIW I do feel that 7900XT has really gotten the pitchfork brigade unfairly too.  Yes, bad card at $900.  At $700 it's getting down into reasonableness - although it still has the same struggles around FSR/DLSS except at 4K.  But I just don't think AMD cares, they can't reasonably fix it without some kind of ML core, so they're just gonna cater to the ""native res is the only res"" crowd.

On the other hand, I also am not expecting much from the Navi 32 cards.  I think like the 7600 they're basically going to slot in over the prices of their RDNA2 performance equivalents, while being weaker in some ways.  Again, like, whatever N32 AMD slots at $500 is not going to be better than a 6800XT, it's gonna be similar-ish but generally a cheaper weaker card that leans on the RDNA3 gimmicks to hold performance up, just like NVIDIA leans on DLSS to hold performance up.  Just like 7600 didn't blow away a 6600XT either.

That's always the tradeoff when you go from a high-end previous gen model to a midrange current-gen model... like 1080 Ti vs 2070/2070S.  The 2070 has a lot of numbers that are lower than the 1080 Ti, because it's using the architectural improvements to push the cost downwards instead of push the performance upwards.  It's a weaker card that tries to get more out of the performance it's got, and that makes it cheaper.  But people want number to go up, forever, and honestly that's not *quite* how it worked even in the glory days.  970 has less raw memory bandwidth than 780 Ti, and so on.  Architectural improvements have always been used to mitigate those cost-reductions while keeping the actual performance going up.","<div class=""md""><p>4070 got slammed by the (a) x70 is supposed to be $329 forever! bandwagon (because of the one singular time they dropped it that low), and (b) general hate bandwagon around Ada.</p>

u/capn_hector,">	AMD just can't stop itself from overpricing their cards, getting lousy reviews, and then dropping the prices down to good value when nobody is paying attention. I really don't get this strategy.

I think it's to avoid the 2070 Super/4070 Ti response.  If they actually *announce* a way lower MSRP then NVIDIA will cut the prices immediately.  If they overprice it and let it float down organically, I think the sense is that NVIDIA generally doesn't care about that.  I don’t understand why nvidia treats it differently but it seems like they do.

You can see like the 7900XT vs the 4080/4070 Ti... when AMD launches the 7900XT/XTX then NVIDIA immediately launches the 4070 Ti in response, but if they just keep letting the XT float downwards *hundreds of dollars*, nothing.  Same for 3060 vs 6600/6600XT/6700XT, or 3070 vs 6800/6800XT/6950XT... AMD just floats the prices right on down and NVIDIA studiously ignores it.  And of course the classic 5700XT leading to Super, 290X leading to 780 Ti, etc.

So they take it on the chin in reviews, but they get the actual sales out of it.  Yeah, it'd be better to get both, but, they kinda can't get both.  The only thing they get from that is lower margins.

And I do think margins are getting to be more of an issue in the low end than people think.  PHYs don't shrink and are starting to dominate the area of low-end cards, that's why they kept N33 on 6nm too.  Launch at $279, sell at $200, OK, but they can't afford to launch at $200, have NVIDIA respond, and be forced down to $149 or whatever on an 8GB card.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>
