u/QuinSanguine,"A high-end GPU today, I would in theory go as high as $699, assuming that would be the lower tier take on the high end. Games today are ridiculously complex and running them at 4k requires a lot of engineering, so I can understand paying a little more but not $1600.

I say in theory because I game at 1080p, I like a smaller screen, less eye fatigue and I don't need more resolution. So I'd pay up to $400 for a mid-range 1080p/1440p GPU.","<div class=""md""><p>A high-end GPU today, I would in theory go as high as $699, assuming that would be the lower tier take on the high end.
