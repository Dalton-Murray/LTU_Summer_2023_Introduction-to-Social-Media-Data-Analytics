We're currently in a state of consumer chip oversupply, so patient gamers can probably expect some more price drops in the short term. However, there are already rumors that Nvidia (no word yet on AMD) is set to reduce production of consumer chips in order to better match the cold demand for graphics cards.

How exactly it ends is hard to predict. It could be that prices will raise back up to MSRP once the undersupply meets the under-demand. Personally, I think Nvidia and AMD will just let these discounts stay the way they are and just replace existing SKUs with ""Super"" refreshes.

In these cases of tiebreaker it is a pretty big lean in Nvidia‰Ûªs favor.

[According to HUB‰Ûªs video on the topic,](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy3ikm8MxOM) the 6950XT is 15% faster at 1440p and that‰Ûªs significantly less than the amount that DLSS Quality adds (while maintaining roughly native quality output), and FSR2 Quality mode has bad output at 1440p. If you are willing to take the quality loss from using FSR2 quality mode for a 20-30% bump, DLSS2 performance mode will bump the DLSS increase to more like 50% and it utterly blows the 6950XT away at equal visual quality again. That‰Ûªs the situation AMD finds themselves in competing against DLSS, their cards really need to be delivering around 30% more raw raster to keep up with the image quality loss from FSR2 in the 1080p and 1440p segments given how bad FSR2 is at those resolutions. Dlss2 quality is roughly on par with native (often better, actually), it‰Ûªs essentially free frames, and FSR2 is **not**, especially at 1080p and 1440p where it‰Ûªs rather poor.

If you think of upscaling like an op-amp‰Û? there is a gain ratio and AMD cards are simply much noisier for a given gain ratio. So they need to be offering a stronger input signal to offset that, because to the end user it doesn‰Ûªt matter - stronger input vs cleaner gain is an implementation detail, all they care is that it sounds the same. And nvidia has got it to the point where their first setting of gain doesn't add any noise, and if you don‰Ûªt want the gain you can choose DLAA and get cleaner-than-native output for free instead. That‰Ûªs the marketing problem AMD faces in the 1080p and 1440p segments. Also, all of this applies to intel as well, their XeSS is much closer to DLSS2 than FSR2, AMD is significantly behind *both* competitors.

Let alone any kind of perf/w comparison‰Û?. 6950XT consumes 200W more power to get that 15% native res win, and cost 5% more, at the time of their video (it‰Ûªs gone up a bit more since as stock depletes).  And DLSS doesn't really increase the card power, the TDP budget is what it is and the framerate is what it is.  It's a cheap way to render more frames per watt and more frames period.  Laptop dGPU is a dying segment but DLSS is absolutely a must-have if you are buying a gaming laptop imo.  Ada is pushing like 2x the native perf/w of RDNA2, and with DLSS piled in that rises to like, 250-300% of the perf/w of RDNA2 dGPUs.

Yes, the 6950XT has 4GB more but the 4070 isn‰Ûªt up against the wall in the same way the 8gb cards are. Series S has 8GB of VRAM and series X has 10GB, so, it‰Ûªs probably not going to massively massively increase such that 12gb is unplayable.

It‰Ûªs arguable but at equal price the balance really does tip towards the 4070, even Steve is onboard with that one. If you can get a 6800XT for $450 or $500 then whatever but the era of paying $600-700 for Navi 21 is really drawing to a close. Giving up DLSS and/or suffering through FSR2 1440p at 200w more power and 5% higher cost for a 10% performance advantage and 4GB more vram really is not worth it in the big picture.

4070 is a legit decent card, it‰Ûªs just not a return to Moores law era progress. The 3080 and 3060 ti were the value peak of the lineup and struggled to reach msrp, 4070 being a more efficient 3080 12gb for $100 less really is not bad. With the $100 microcenter steam GC deal it‰Ûªs actually pretty great, 4070 12gb for de facto $500 is about as good as things are going to get this gen.

That is mostly a shipping cost and legal issue with scammers. Shipping inside of Germany is dirt cheap with DHL. The moment you cross the border even by one meter, that price really jumps up a lot. 

Now combine that with a very active community of thief's that use stolen PayPal, visa, and other payment methods to buy items. By the time it's get flagged as stolen, the seller is eating that cost because if you want to report the issue, well, good luck dealing with French of Romanian police. I also do not like it but as long as our justice system is so fragmented in Europe, well ...

The issue is also, lets say they ship to Belgium. Maybe they have less problem with scammers there, but if you ship to Belgium, the next guy in Romania can say ""hey, you are discriminating my EU country"" (what technically is correct, it is a form of discrimination and that is against some EU laws of goods sold in EU). So, it became ""We simply ship to nobody"".

My father yeaaaars ago dealt with a Polish seller for some wood stove. He wanted to buy directly from Poland (and pay shipping). They said: ""No, we have a distributor in your country, you need to use him"". 

Except that guy was asking like 50% more for the exact same thing, that this distributor needed to order from ... Poland. Dad fed up (and stubborn as a mule) contacted EU and said, ""hey, they are selling these products across border using a distributor, that means i can order directly from them"". Yep, EU agreed, and Polish shop needed to sell directly. And if you only sell inside your own country, well, EU cannot force you to sell outside your country, but if you have a network or selective sell outside, then you need to sell to ALL EU countries.

So i hope this explains a few things...

> May I ask what do you use to sell / buy used instead of Ebay?

For the bulk is still Ebay, they still have the best buy protection, sell protection is kind of iffy and i always advice people to document EVERYTHING. Your good working, take picture, put them in box, pictures, packaging, pictures, label, pictures... Really helps with issue buyers.

It's just a lot less people then in the past so it takes longer to sell items. 

Part of the issue with affordable hardware is, people simply do not bother selling on eBay and throw stuff in a corner. The high sales tax really hurt selling anything below a X value, as your time/effort vs $$$ became an issue (combine that with thiefs/scammers/karens). So, this is probably one of the reasons eBay removed the tax. Dwindling sales and less people. In other words, i do not think people move to different planforms so much as people simply stopped selling their old stuff and chucked it. I also did this a lot in the last few years. It was not worth the hassle vs the money stuff sold at (after ebay their tax).

A alternative is Kleinanzeigen.de (owned by ebay as they bought up almost every secondhand platform in Europe). It's very, VERY unregulated and even more open for abuse. Burned a few times there. With also a very small buyer/seller group.

Amazon is an alternative for secondhand sales these days but i have no experience with their policies.

For paypal this can be true. Chargebacks are a thing, however with many other payment methods including credit card, this isn't so. 
In EU you should explicitly require 3DS as mandated by PSD2 ratification. As such, the risk shifts to the cardholder/bank. You can easily limit payment methods, for certain customers. It's not particularly hard, unheard of or illegal.

So, it became ""We simply ship to nobody"".

This is also not true. You can discriminate countries and indeed you do so. Go to amazon.es and try to order a battery operated item to your native country. Chances are you will not be able to due to safety regulations that make sending stuff around more difficult than in-country.

Giving Spain or Portugal as examples. These two countries have islands, some of which do not have airports and the commodities are shipped via boat. Even within these countries it was and is possible to have shipments denied - especially for large appliances. I believe, recently Portugal had a law change that makes it so national delivery must be possible but my memory is fuzzy and cba to google.

In reality, it's very much a business choice. You have to factor in logistical cost, mis-shipments, damages during transport and all the customer support headaches that come from that. Further, now you'd have to probably support different support languages, have your website calculate shipping costs to different regions (more ship vias, perhaps different carriers, different cargo calculations at warehouse/hub/stores/whatever, etc) and then incorporate all of this into your accountancy and forecasting.
Perhaps you'd need to cross-dock somewhere (big appliances often do, due to size), etc. Dropshipping now becomes an issue as it must cross-dock in your facilities if the supplier can't deliver there, effectively transforming these items into long tail items - once again adding risk/cost to you since now you're responsible for everything and not the supplier as well as making the lead time longer...

In sum, all of this is added complexity and at the end of the day it's just a decision of cost vs net margin vs growth and I'd say for this company the numbers just aren't there to justify all of this hassle.

4080 and 4060 Ti are unsalvageable at their current pricing, and 4070 Ti and 4060 16GB will be mediocre, but 4070 is actually a solid card at a solid price and has *enough* VRAM, although 16GB would have been nicer at that price (I understand the hardware reasons ofc).  4060 8GB and 4070 really are both great cards given the way node costs/etc have risen.

But x70 is such a popular segment and everybody loves the 970, and remembers the fake non-FE MSRP that nobody followed for the 1070.  And everyone is just so primed for ""new cards are bad, don't buy"" that even actual good deals just don't penetrate the hivemind.  It drove me nuts that people didn't think the microcenter deal (effectively $500 for a 4070) was even very good, like that was just ""ok"" to people.  That was actually an amazing deal and the alternative is going to be shit like the 4060 Ti 16GB.  People aren't going to like whatever Navi 32 product AMD farts out at that price segment either.

People also love to do comparisons against the 3060 Ti MSRP which was literally never at MSRP until like a month ago, or mix and match the 3080 10GB (cheaper, smaller VRAM) against the 3080 12GB (no official MSRP), and the 4070 really is the best of both worlds and also $100 cheaper.  Same for 4060/Ti, people start compare against the 3070 performance and mixing that with the 3060 Ti price and then whining that it doesn't stack a bunch of additional improvement on top of that.  4060 Ti is still mediocre but 4060 being 3060 Ti perf for $300 is really pretty great actually, you're 25% cheaper than the very best card in the 30-series lineup that literally never hit MSRP until like two months ago because it was too damn cheap for partners to want to make it.

FWIW I do feel that 7900XT has really gotten the pitchfork brigade unfairly too.  Yes, bad card at $900.  At $700 it's getting down into reasonableness - although it still has the same struggles around FSR/DLSS except at 4K.  But I just don't think AMD cares, they can't reasonably fix it without some kind of ML core, so they're just gonna cater to the ""native res is the only res"" crowd.

On the other hand, I also am not expecting much from the Navi 32 cards.  I think like the 7600 they're basically going to slot in over the prices of their RDNA2 performance equivalents, while being weaker in some ways.  Again, like, whatever N32 AMD slots at $500 is not going to be better than a 6800XT, it's gonna be similar-ish but generally a cheaper weaker card that leans on the RDNA3 gimmicks to hold performance up, just like NVIDIA leans on DLSS to hold performance up.  Just like 7600 didn't blow away a 6600XT either.

That's always the tradeoff when you go from a high-end previous gen model to a midrange current-gen model... like 1080 Ti vs 2070/2070S.  The 2070 has a lot of numbers that are lower than the 1080 Ti, because it's using the architectural improvements to push the cost downwards instead of push the performance upwards.  It's a weaker card that tries to get more out of the performance it's got, and that makes it cheaper.  But people want number to go up, forever, and honestly that's not *quite* how it worked even in the glory days.  970 has less raw memory bandwidth than 780 Ti, and so on.

I really don't get this strategy.

I think it's to avoid the 2070 Super/4070 Ti response.  If they actually *announce* a way lower MSRP then NVIDIA will cut the prices immediately.  If they overprice it and let it float down organically, I think the sense is that NVIDIA generally doesn't care about that.  I don‰Ûªt understand why nvidia treats it differently but it seems like they do.

You can see like the 7900XT vs the 4080/4070 Ti... when AMD launches the 7900XT/XTX then NVIDIA immediately launches the 4070 Ti in response, but if they just keep letting the XT float downwards *hundreds of dollars*, nothing.  Same for 3060 vs 6600/6600XT/6700XT, or 3070 vs 6800/6800XT/6950XT... AMD just floats the prices right on down and NVIDIA studiously ignores it.  And of course the classic 5700XT leading to Super, 290X leading to 780 Ti, etc.

So they take it on the chin in reviews, but they get the actual sales out of it.  Yeah, it'd be better to get both, but, they kinda can't get both.  The only thing they get from that is lower margins.

And I do think margins are getting to be more of an issue in the low end than people think.

It gets even worse down the stack. 2016 the 1050 ti was $140 MSRP and when i bought sold for around $180. Nowadays, you get a 1650 at that price range, a card that came out in 2018 and was only around 25% better than a 1050 ti. 1660 ti is around $230. In 2018 it was the 1660 and in 2016 it was the 1060 3 GB. Another paltry performance gain. 1070 in 2016. We got the 2060 in 2018. Then the 3060 and 3060 Ti in 2020/2021. More measly 50% gains roughly.

You get the idea. I couldnt care less about die sizes and OMG this is GA102, this is 104, blah blah blah. DOnt care. I care about ""what performance can i get for the money"", and honestly this level of stagnation is so bad it should be triggering anti trust investigations into the GPU market. Because something is fundamentally unhealthy here.

In order to double my last card, i needed to buy AMD, because AMD for some reason is selling their GPUs a whole tier of price lower than nvidia, which is what everyone should've been doing in the first place.

if you want to know what i think GPU pricing would be fair, I'd say, take the cheapest RDNA2 cards over the past 3 months and about that.

6600s for around $200 is fair. 6650 XTs for $250-300 is fair. 6700 XTs for $350-400 is fair. 6800s for around $500 is fair. 6950 XTs for $700 is fair. That's what the market should've looked like all along. Heck i just wish we had some serious budget options too. 6500 XT is a massive gap in performance down for not a lot less money. And the 6400 is just pathetic. 6500 XT should be like $120ish and the 6400 should be sub $100 IMO.

In reality, the first 80 tier card as we now know them, the GTX 280, was launched at $649, and that was back in 2008. Corrected for inflation, that would be almost $900 today. Extremely high competition from AMD's 4000 series forced Nvidia to drop the price down to $499 (and, even at $499, it was still $200 more than the highly competitive HD4870).

&#x200B;

>And every generation, we would see healthy gains in price/performance. Sometimes 20-30% during a refresh generation, but sometimes up to double.

And 1st wave Ampere also brought that, which was my original point. 3080/70 had double the performance-per-dollar than 2080/Ti cards.

&#x200B;

>But after 3 years, you'd think we'd get something like that for $250. We didn't.

Turing had the 16-series GPUs to cover this price range, as you've already mentioned. While Ampere has the RTX 3050 at this price range. If we factor inflation, the RTX 3050 is actually cheaper than the GTX 1060 was.

&#x200B;

>Then nvidia did the same thing with the 3060, charged $330 for it and people acted like they were doing us a favor.

I never saw anyone say this. The RTX 3060 came after the 3060 Ti, and, if anything, it always regarded as terrible value, given the 3060 Ti offered over 33% more performance for 20% more money. If anything, the 3060 kickstarted Ampere's second-wave of cards - those that offered progressively worse performance-per-dollar. 1st-wave Ampere (3070, 3080 and 3060 Ti - not 3090 for obvious reasons) was the last time the market see Nvidia launch truly compelling products.

&#x200B;

>Either way, yeah, the 1080 ti was $700. And anything above that is a scam.

As was the 3080.

&#x200B;

>Performance per dollar only improved 50% on the nvidia side. IN SIX YEARS. That's insane. Historically before than we saw a doubling in performance every 3.

That's because performance per dollar has been stagnant since the 3080 was launched, back in 2020.

&#x200B;

>For reference, the 2500k to the 7600k was also 50%, so we're at intel stagnation levels of price/performance.

CPUs can't scale like GPUs because CPU workloads are highly sequential, as opposed to graphics which are tremendously parallel workloads. It's easier to scale compute units than it is to make those compute units faster, this is why GPUs improve faster than CPUs.

&#x200B;

>We got the 2060 in 2018. Then the 3060 and 3060 Ti in 2020/2021. More measly 50% gains roughly.

The 3060 Ti was a **great** GPU. It was brutally faster than **anything** priced below it, and it delivered performance over the $699 2080 Super... for $399. If you want to compare it with Pascal, it offered nearly double the performance of the 1070 which shared the same MSRP. Plus, you had DLSS and RT. So, in just two generations, the 3060 Ti was offering twice the performance per dollar (even more if you adjust for inflation), plus DLSS and RT support.

The 3080 is cut down 19% from the full die, the 1080 and 2080 are cut down 36% and 33% respectively. The 2080 Ti is cut down 5%.

You got the numbers right for the 3080 and 2080 Ti. Not for the 1080 and 2080. The 2080 had 46/48 SMs and the 1080 had a fully enabled GP104 (20/20 SMs).

>So the 3080 is roughly halfway between a 2080 and 2080 Ti in terms of SM count compared to the full die.

That's misleading, to say the least. The 3080 performs within 90% of a 3090, which features a nearly full GA102 and operates at comparable power levels. I'll take the 3090 Ti out of the equation because the 3090 Ti relies most of its performance uplift on the massive 450W TDP (which, in real-world testing, is closer to 480W for the reference FE model) rather than any actual architectural upgrades (it's only got 2 more SMs than the 3090). If you feed 3080s and 3090s with the same 480W (which isn't a far-fetched idea, given all those cards are based off the exact same die; if a 3090 Ti chip can take 480W, so can any other GA102 chip), most of the performance advantage of the 3090 Ti will be gone.

Unlike the 3080, the 2080 and 1080 performed nowhere near the bigger models. Even with partially disabled chips, the 1080 Ti and 2080 Ti brutally outperformed their 104 siblings. The 1080 Ti was, in average, 35% faster than the 1080 at 4K. Meanwhile, the 2080 Ti still outperformed the 2080 by nearly 30%, and that's considering that, at the stock 250W TDP, it operated nearly 300Mhz below the 2080. As a reference, the 2080 had a 215W TDP. In other words, it had 67% the SMs but 86% the TDP. This is why so many AIB 2080 Tis would operate over 300W, which allowed them to operate at similar clock speeds to 2080 cards; even overclocked 2080s. The TU102 had no problems operating as fast as the TU104, as long as it had comparable power per SM (and adequate cooling to boot). Once you adjusted the cards to operate at similar clockspeeds, the 2080 Ti opened an even bigger performance advantage over the 2080.

The bottom line here is that, in the end of the day, what really matters is what chip your GPU has. Obviously, a full version of a chip will perform better than a partially disabled chip. However, the truth of the fact is that all cards that feature a same chip will perform relatively close to each other, just look at the 3080 and 3090 and how close they are to each other. Similarly, the 3060 Ti offers near-to-3070 levels of performance, and this comes ate no surprise as it features the same chip. Now, step down to the 3060 and there's a massive performance drop, they're nowhere near in performance. And that's easily explained by the 3060 using a lower tier chip. Of course, there are some exceptions, like the first GA106-powered RTX 3050s. In essence, because the GA107s weren't ready available at the time, the first 3050s to hit the market featured the GA106 instead of the GA107 which should have equipped it since the beginning. Reducing the GA106 to GA107 levels means the chip is massively capped at 2/3 its capacity. Obviously, this type of decision only serves as a temporary solution, given it makes no financial sense to commercialize chips at such reduced capacities. As a reference, the smallest GA102 - the 3080, still features a full fat 20 SMs more than a fully enabled GA104.",2,1/24/2023 4:55,FALSE,FALSE,GPU Pricing Update: Hardware Still Overpriced?,t1_j5nogi9,,j5le3en,u/GruntChomper,"> I'm looking at something for emulating, VR, and NVENC, which AMD isn't as friendly with.",9,1/23/2023 15:54,FALSE,FALSE,GPU Pricing Update: Hardware Still Overpriced?,t1_j5l0urr,,j5owef2,u/Sexyvette07,"Intel has made huge progress on the drivers in a very little amount of time.

200 series was a bit weird, akin to the 2000 series where nvidia just tried charging insane prices for new hardware, but that time AMD massively undercut them and it corrected the market.

You get the point.

And the 16 series was weak and provided only a 35% improvement in price/performance. The 3050 was garbage. And ERMAHGERD INFLATION, THAT JUSTIFIES EVERYTHING.

>I never saw anyone say this. The RTX 3060 came after the 3060 Ti, and, if anything, it always regarded as terrible value, given the 3060 Ti offered over 33% more performance for 20% more money. If anything, the 3060 kickstarted Ampere's second-wave of cards - those that offered progressively worse performance-per-dollar. 1st-wave Ampere (3070, 3080 and 3060 Ti - not 3090 for obvious reasons) was the last time the market see Nvidia launch truly compelling products.

Cool, except it was exactly $400, which was way too expensive for a 60 series card, and keep in mind, does nothing for any of us in the sub $400 market.

I dont care how great these cards were for rich people. Im a normal person who buys $200-300 GPUs. Your arguments do not connect with me at all. Because I see it as ""1060 -> 1660 ti/super -> 3050"". That's a HORRID improvement in 6 years. 

>As was the 3080.

yeah and 80 cards normally go for $500-600.

Besides youre missing the point that now there are literally three tiers of card above that and we're a whole tier lower than 2017.

>That's because performance per dollar has been stagnant since the 3080 was launched, back in 2020.

it's been stagnant for far longer if you're NOT in the $800 segment. JESUS.

>CPUs can't scale like GPUs because CPU workloads are highly sequential, as opposed to graphics which are tremendously parallel workloads. It's easier to scale compute units than it is to make those compute units faster, this is why GPUs improve faster than CPUs.

Jesus christ you're dense.

Way to miss the point.

>The 3060 Ti was a great GPU. It was brutally faster than anything priced below it, and it delivered performance over the $699 2080 Super... for $399. If you want to compare it with Pascal, it offered nearly double the performance of the 1070 which shared the same MSRP. Plus, you had DLSS and RT. So, in just two generations, the 3060 Ti was offering twice the performance per dollar (even more if you adjust for inflation), plus DLSS and RT support.

Cool, except it LITERALLY DOES NOTHING FOR THOSE OF US WITH 1060S.

Jesus christ you're dense. It's like you're literally the ""well ackshully"" guy. Like holy ####, touch grass. Seriously. 

I ain't doing this any more. You are clueless.

If you wanna look at what i consider good pricing, look at the AMD side of things. I literally bought a 6650 XT, which is almost on par with your lauded 3060 Ti for **$230**. That's a deal. Nvidia is price gauging. The only decently priced cards for what they offer right now are the AMD 6000 series.

> I‰Ûªve seen a few reporters build that exact connection, but it‰Ûªs misguided. The days of crypto-driven-type GPU shortages are behind us. Although we‰Ûªll likely see a surge in demand for graphics cards as AI continues to boom, that demand isn‰Ûªt directed toward the best graphics cards installed in gaming rigs.  

...  

> Nvidia‰Ûªs gaming GPUs generally aren‰Ûªt suitable for AI due to how little video memory they have compared to enterprise-grade hardware, but there‰Ûªs a separate issue here as well. Nvidia‰Ûªs workstation GPUs don‰Ûªt usually share a GPU die with its gaming cards.  

> For instance, the A100 that Heaton referenced uses the GA100 GPU, which is a die from Nvidia‰Ûªs Ampere range that was never used on gaming-focused cards (including the high-end RTX 3090 Ti). Similarly, Nvidia‰Ûªs latest H100 uses a completely different architecture than the RTX 40-series, meaning it uses a different die as well.  

> There are exceptions. Nvidia‰Ûªs AD102 GPU, which is inside the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080, is also used in a small range of Ada Lovelace enterprise GPUs (the L40 and RTX 6000). In most cases, though, Nvidia can‰Ûªt just repurpose a gaming GPU die for a data center card. They‰Ûªre separate worlds.  

> There are some fundamental differences between the GPU shortage we saw due to crypto-mining and the rise in popularity of AI models. According to Heaton, the GPT-3 model required over 1,000 A100 Nvidia GPUs to train~~s~~ and about eight to run.

The reason why GPUs are not as widely produced as other PC hardware, which is why they often have higher prices, is due to the complexity of their design and the high cost associated with manufacturing them. The production of GPUs requires advanced technology, specialized equipment, and skilled labor, which limits the number of companies capable of producing them.

As a result, the few companies that do manufacture GPUs hold a significant amount of power in the market, giving them the ability to set prices as high as they want. This is because consumers have no other choice but to purchase their products, as there are no alternative brands or products that can match the performance and quality of their GPUs.

Furthermore, the demand for GPUs has increased significantly in recent years due to the rise of gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and artificial intelligence applications. This has further strengthened the position of GPU manufacturers, allowing them to increase prices even more.

This allows most of the resources to be dedicated to what's currently on screen vs what's 'behind' the screen and in the distance. 

This is also *incredibly* difficult and time consuming to do without things like loading screens or the player noticing pop-in etc. It's also something that has diminishing returns, meaning actual optimization comes down to how consistent the game is at running on the intended hardware vs how long it would take to improve that performance. It's why some games force you to slow down in certain areas or why 90% of game time in the original Mass Effect was spent riding elevators on the citadel; it allows things to load in the background without having to look at an actual loading screen.

So lets say you fix/add/move 50 things on the map on day one, then come back the next day to check on the results ...you need to move some of these object 3 to 6 times before you are happy with the actual result.  
You spend the entire week messing with one object, which in Unreal would be done in 2 minutes, drag and dop, check the result live done.  

This sort of thing will drive you slowly mad.   
Especially when you are aware that a different set of tools does it so much better.  
And when RayTracing is omnipresent, all these clunky old lighting engines that need to ""bake"" a light or shadowmap or what its called, would be obsolete.  

Which is why all the above mentioned Studios instantly tilted back to Unreal Engine after messing with those engines.  

Ray Tracing yeah, well that will fix the problem by just not having to deal with lighting passes at all anymore.  
Of course Dev's would gush about this.  

And every dev studio using Unreal Engine, turning it into a monopoly for EPIC is also not the answer.  
I like when there are multiple competing engines on the market.  
I like Unreal Engine, but i don't want every game to look and feel the same either.  
Frostbite Games like Star Wars Battlefront looked damn awesome.  

We even had DICE devs from BF2042 publicly bitching about Frostbite... their own in-house engine!  
One of the criticisms about 2042 was the lack of cover on the big open maps.  
Development was clearly rushed again, now put 1+1 together, big new 128 player maps and still the same old lighting pass bakery stuff... i'd say there is a good chance the map design in that game was shit because they didn't have time to mess with cover enough.  
They are slowly going through the maps now in patches, one map at a time and rework them, adding more stuff and more cover.  
That is the flipside of it, Publishers will rush games out the door regardless, if the tools are better we get less buggy games at release.

This should be taken into consideration with every debate regarding the value proposition. We have to compare apples to apples, and consoles can only run games in native 4K at 30 FPS and medium settings. Many PC (and not necessarily with top notch hardware) can do this.

When devs want their game at 60 FPS, then they drop resolution most of the time by using variable resolution and that is not 4K. It still looks great, but if we are comparing the value proposition then we should consider this because 1440p upscaled to 4K at 60 FPS is not that hard to achieve neither it is 4K native at 30 FPS.

5) BIOS reset buttons on the back of the board are nice, but pretty much all boards have the reset pins on them already. maybe a little more difficult to get to, but a button could be wired up fairly easily during the build and then left inside the case somewhere. i mean, realistically, how often do you need to use it anyway.

6) loads upon loads of boards will have the headers, but like you point out they may be in awkward locations. extension cables and harnesses are abundant and cheap, and will work with any modern board. you don't really even need two of them, just one, the plug in your harness, and split it off to other fans. 

if you read through what i wrote, i mention add on, or other, solutions a lot. the fact that you can get a board that does all those things WITHOUT all the different modifications is going to be great. ESPECIALLY since you're looking for all that in a ITX package, which is going to be quite limited on space. 

like we tell customers at the shop i work, small costs extra. so yeah, that's all special use case, that is not in any way representative of the average needs. the examples i pointed out of customers coming in with high end boards, where they're using mid range CPUs, and the power pins aren't hooked up correctly, could've just used the $80 boards i'm using/have used.

His argument kept coming down to price and how he got his 6800 XT for $550ish and how I must have overpaid for my 3080. Or how awesome the 6600 XT and 6700 XT are compared to NVIDIA's offerings.

AMD's offers a much higher performing product at a lower price depending on the segment...*NOW*.

After that, they were basically vaporware for 6 months. If you wanted one, you couldn't buy one even at scalper pricing because AMD didn't bother to make any in any real volume.

When the stock was finally made and shipped to retail, they were priced just as high as NVIDIA'S offerings were if not more so: 6700 XTs were routinely selling for $900 to $1000 at Microcenter, 6800s didn't exist, 6800 XTs were $1400, and 6900 XTs were $2300+.

On it's year of release, the GTX 1060 with 6gb of ram was $299. That's not even the entry or budget GPU, those were the 1050ti that were $199. It was also a huge jump in performance. The 1060 landed somewhere very close to 980 performance levels.

Even adjusting for inflation a 1060 would be about $370 today. Can you imagine Nvidia launching the 4060 at $370 or $399? I think it's more likely going to roll out at $499 at least given where they're positioning the 4070ti.

The 1060 was a solid choice for anyone wanting to game at 1080p. And the pricing going up from there made sense, you were getting less frames per dollar, but you paid more and more halo tier pricing to go up a level.

Now that has been flipped on it's head. The best value per dollar is the $1600 monster, and the lower tiers don't even reflect the drop in performance in their pricing. A 4070ti at $799 (which you'll never see since they didn't make any founders models, all the reviewers were sent ASUS TUF which are $850), what the hell are we going to possibly tell people wanting to start into PC Gaming? Go buy a 4 year old secondhand GPU?

Even if you can afford these GPU prices, **skip this generation** (if possible) because if we support this pricing in this generation they won't change in the next generation. And so there will be less PC gamers and so game devs will make less PC games - especially games that take advantage of high end hardware.

Also remember that NVIDIA is marketing their cards in the wrong classifications making the pricing even more egregious. Yes, they're faster than last generation, but **that's how it's supposed to be**! That's how it's always been. It's no argument for drastically higher prices.

The pricing is not responding properly to high supply and low demand. This requires proper competition but it's obvious that AMD was happy to respond to NVIDIA's absurd prices with (only slightly less) absurd prices of their own.

In addition I can work on my pc so now it has two use cases. I can store all my families photos and videos on it with an expansion drive just for saving that. This doesn‰Ûªt even require a GPU. 

These prices for GPUs are ridiculous. They are getting away with it because there is a ton of money floating around. Can I afford the 4090? Sure. Will I pay it? F*** no. I still believe in value. I believe in limits. No matter how much I love my hobby there‰Ûªs a limit where I go this is crazy and I will not indulge in it.

> I think it will push some out.

I completely disagree. I think the issue here is you guys are too focused on the best and not what delivers good performance. For the VAST majority of PC gamers there's absolutely no reason to even go above the 2xxx series, something which is reflected in steam hardware surveys.

Yeah sure, we don't get shiny settings like RTX (at playable framerates) or native 4k, but why am I buying anything above the xx60ti lines to play games? At some point there's a huge amount of diminishing returns and I have to believe people are just doing it because they enjoy taking screenshots. Almost no games require that power to run at 1440 < and with DLSS 4k is achievable without needing them either. Unless someone wants to brag they can do native 4k at 60fps or whatever then I guess that's cool, but for the vast majority of gamers I don't think they care that much.

GPU pricing isn't an issue with the mid ranged cards since they are at MSRP (and are reasonable) and most games aren't even pushing those, so why bother?

- Buying a console because the enthusiast card is high priced. If you are looking at a 4070TI, which is a whole generation ahead of the consoles, I don't see why you would go buy a Xbox instead?

Again where the consoles offer a clear advantage is if you are building an entire PC from scratch since the video card will end up being an increasingly large cost and drive up overall cost for just parity. But there is a little bit of the sky is falling going on in these discussions.

The 1070ti actually holds its ground vs the 3060 was fairly similarly priced. The 3060ti was never at MSRP and the 3070ti was often even a little below MSRP. I don't care what tier of GPU something was in or the supposed MSRP. The reality is $375-425 was pretty common for a 3060. And after 5 or so years you hardly get an upgrade in games where pascals architecture doesn't hold up so well like Resident evil there's a good 30-35% advantage for the 3060 but for a lot of games, they're within 14-20% of each other even in recent games like sniper elite 5 which surprised me.

That‰Ûªs only true to a very small degree.

So you can‰Ûªt compare EU prices to US prices, because they‰Ûªre not the same kind of prices. Most of the time, the launch prices are almost exactly the same as US MSRP, plus taxes.

Let me explain.
First you are right, I have a 1070 and yes. You are 100% right of course but let me be realistic when it comes to games. 

I'm 3x year old. I am wealthy now. I remember when 1070 came out. I spend so many months saving. Now I could buy a 4090, I have the income, I have no kids, but why? I actually did spend the money mind you. I bought myself a Sony A6600 with entire Sigma Prime Lens Trio and A 18-50 Zoom lens and that wasn't enough so I went and got a Super Zoom Sony 70-350mm. When you sum it up it's more then a 4090.

But thats not the issue. Since I'm also old let me put it like this. 

When UT came out you needed a GPU or you were stuck at playing a 320x240 Software 400x300 if you had a really good CPU. UT was the game everyone played. It was the top game. Same goes for everything down the line. Half Life, Half Life 2, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, Red Alert 2, CnC Generals, Company of Heroes.

All these games needed better, newer, more capable hardware. 

Oh your GPU can't do the new version of DirectX too bad, oh your GPU can't do T&L too bad. You were blocked from playing games.

Now on my 1070 with 1080p60 am I blocked by anything? 

New games keep coming out, I see no issue or reason to upgrade.

Elden Ring? I could run it.
Ghostwire Tokyo? I could run it. 
TL Warhammer III? I could run it. 
OW2? I could run it technically but I am never playing a Blizzard game in my life every again no matter the quality.

The point being. Aside from the occasional mega hit that requires a good GPU most of the game that people play these days don't need one.

Vallorat, CS GO, Genshin Impact, Apex, Warzone, LoL, Dota 2, Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, PubG, Fall Guys and so on for the normal people.

All of these will run really well on 1080p60 with a 1060 6 GB. 

For the older guys like me Paradox Games, Dyson Sphere, Civ, Humankind, Anno 1800, Cities Skylines, and so on... they're all good with 1060.

And I mean you're seeing this with the PS5. I have one. It's sitting collecting dust because what am I going to play on it? People seem to be playing 95% PS4 games on it. And then an occasional hit comes out you play it for 1~4 weeks and you go back to the social games like FFXIV or Genshin or Apex etc...

Like yeah Windows was free for a long time, but if you don't have an existing license to sub in it's not actually free. I can get excluding screen/panel costs cause that comes up no matter the platform though, but excluding input on PC also doesn't make sense... console includes input for one person PC does not.

Also worth mentioning how many of those builds cut corners on PSU and mobo which have a hell of a lot of impact on the lifespan of the build.

There's no way a card was released 6 years ago with a larger GPU so more silicon and a larger bus memory pool considering the time it was released. If you going to make the inflation argument why was a GPU that cost $200 in 2010, not as a GPU that cost $200 in 2016? And surely if inflation from 2016/2017 to 2021/2022 was at a push 15-20% surely then we'd get a GPU with the same die size as the RX 480 at $220-250 instead of close to $400. There's never been a period of time in which the same amount of money couldn't have got you an upgrade.

&#x200B;

You talk about silicon prices going up explain the 5700xt costing $400-450 in 2019 which had a similar GPU die size to the rx 480... The die size is clearly what matters the most it's the big silicon GPU.

 You clearly have no understanding of how these things are made because the 5700xt couldn't have really cost much more to make than the rx 480. It was built on TSMC 7nm so there's a little bit of a difference in cost per wafer but the actual GPU was smaller than the RX 480 and cards like the 5600xt had less memory and a smaller bus but still cost quite a lot more.

I wouldn't even bring MSRP into the discussion because the gtx 1070 and 1070 ti were always at or often below MSRP. During the entire lifecycle of the 3000 series and even the 2000 series, GPUs were never below MSRP. The 2080ti was a $999 MSRP GPU but it was always $1200 the 2070 super was $50 over MSRP.

Go look up the supposed MSRP of the GTX 1060 it was $299 but the GPU was often sold below $240 so if you're saying MSRP is unfair because of inflation. The MSRP of pascal was almost the highest price anyone paid for these GPUs whereas they were the absolute lowest prices people paid for the 3000 series.

Nvidia has gone nuts on pricing of their new GPUs, which they can keep.

But there remains ample room in the PC gaming space for 1080p and 1440p/2K gaming on a budget. And speaking as a long-time console gamer who returned to PC gaming recently, it is, by far, a better experience than consoles.

Some people would add, ""except for 4K gaming"" here, but I won't. The Series X and PS5, only rocking as they are merely the equivalent of an RX 6650 XT, are heavily reliant on compromises to make these resolutions happen.

See new release God of War: Ragnarok, which offers players the option to lock the frame rate at 60fps, and allow the dynamic resolution to dip as low as 1440p, or to lock it at 30fps and play in 4K. Because nothing says welcome to the future like playing action games at 30fps.

So I think it's a disservice to would-be PC gamers sounding out what to expect in performance and value, to *even unintentionally* feed the perception that consoles are a better value, by conflating the 1080p and 1440p/2K tier GPUs with their massively more overpriced cousins at the top end of the market.

With these higher-end cards existing largely to, by sheer brute force, beat 4K textures into submission and fit them into a gaming space where this setting has always meant making compromises.

That's not a problem to worry about, today, unless one is similarly burdened by a fat wad of cash and a sense of urgency to be relieved of it. That's why Nvidia is getting away with it right now. If we all needed a 3090, or a 4090, we'd al be screwed. As it is? People are lining up to pay their asking price.

At least they didn't buy the 3080, and aren't buying it re-badged as the 3070 Ti. So they're not stupid. They're just early adopters.

As for the GeForce vs Radeon argument, I'm on my first AMD card since their graphics division was still ATI. For me nVidia's shenanigans (like their insane pricing, twice now, and the mandatory GeForce Now account) combined with the fact that AMD is getting very close to nVidia's performance the pendulum swung AMD's way this time around (well, last time, technically, since I'm on a 6000-series card atm)

You have the 6600 at $250 and the 6650 XT for $275 currently but below that, the market is just broken. You got 1650s, 6400s, 6500 XTs, 1660s, 1660 tis, etc. all selling for within a few dollars of each other, with varying levels of performance. 

Like...the LOW LOW end market has ALWAYS been like this. You ALWAYS have poor GPU pricing at the low low end where you vary between say a GT 710 (bad) and say a 1050 ti (good), since that is now a 6 year old card and should rightfully be low end.

But normally....the NEW 50 cards are in that price range. And you always had good options in that price range. I remember when I got into PC gaming, you could get cards as good as the HD 3850 for like $130. You could get 4770s, 4830s, and 4850s for less than $200, and those cards rocked a lot of the time. You could get the GTS 250, and later the 5750 and even the 5770 (although that was closer to $200) at the time. Those were solid cards.

And later on, stuff like the GTS 450, GTX 750 Ti, 950, and 1050 Ti were all solid buys in the sub $200 range. You never got the best at that price range, you never got something super futureproof, but it was a price tier in its own right where you could get some value cards for around $150ish.

That market is drying up. The sub $100 market is just about GONE, we're selling 1030s for like $120 still last I looked which is freaking pathetic since that card should've gone for like $80 at launch. And we're still selling stuff like 1650s, 6400s, and 6500 XTs at that price range. THose cards have been down there for FOUR YEARS now, and there has been zero improvement per dollar. If anything, it's a regression. And with the $350-400 range being the new ""mid range"" and it seems like they're trying to turn the $200-300 area into the new ""budget"" category and the sub $200 market as that ""you're ####ed"" category, the market is just broken. 

To be fair i blame nvidia more than AMD at the moment for this. AMD has had good value deals on the 6600 and similar cards in the mid range range, which is quite frankly where they should've been all along (remember they cost $330-400 at launch), but ultimately, the low end of the market is feeling squeezed out, hard.",1,1/8/2023 2:34,FALSE,FALSE,price of GPU are insane,t1_j3fx5hg,,j3fzmuu,u/JonWood007,"As a matter of fact the more i think about it this is why im getting annoyed by this situation. We had this happen before. Nvidia actually tried to push insane prices back in like 2008-2009 with their GTX 200 series. Looking at MSRP they wanted like $450 for a GTX 2**6**0. And the 280? $650. 

What did AMD do? Release the 4850 for like $200 which had GTX 260 level performance. Then followed up with the 5850 in 2009 (which I bought, my first REAL GPU) for like $250-300, and it beat the 285. 

We're not competing like that any more. Nvidia is just raising prices by insane amounts and while AMD is undercutting them, they're not doing it aggressively enough. You used to have all of these sub $200 options which were GOOD. Spending $400+ used to be like the high end market. 

Now if you buy sub $200 you get like....1650s and 6500 XTs and stuff. 1660 tis are still in the $200-250 range. 6600 currently starts at $250 when it should be closer to $200 IMO. And yeah.

It's collusion by Nvidia and AMD. AMD is more than happy being little brother to Nvidia in the graphics card space. They could be fighting (and winning) for more market share but announced they cut their chip supply to keep prices high.

I think gamers might be hosed. AI compute power can keep the demand up for GPU's. Nvidia will divert a pittance of high end cards our way if you've got the cash.

If you just want to game, I think I'm going to start recommending consoles. There is no chip shortage, GPU crypto mining is currently dead. There is no reason for the current lack of bargains other than a giant middle finger from AMD and Nvidia. They have us by the balls, and all we can do is walk away and bitch about it on social media.

There is one glimmer of hope. The used market is finally coming down. I saw 3060ti's on eBay for around $230. That's a legit bargain, IMO. I've been waiting 3 years for one. There was also literally a few minute window (almost as quick as the darkest times, where inventory sold out quicker than my browser could refresh) where Best Buy in the US had 3080 FE's for $415. That specific model is almost certainly gone, but keep an eye out for similar fire sales. Warehouse space must be cheap because there is a glut of last gen cards that haven't sold and they're happy trickling them out as to not get our hopes up.

If you can't tell I'm pretty jaded, but they haven't kicked all the hope out of me yet. Things cost what they cost, and I barely have time to play anymore. They've priced me out of the market, and anyway I'm too busy working to afford all the other crap that has shit (that was a typo for 'shot', but fuck it, I'm going to leave it) up in price.

2. Not every game can run ray tracing without crashing on modern hardware. (Watch Daniel Owens recent video on RE4. He could not get the game to run with RT on @ 1440p with a 4070ti. A 1440p card according to Nvidia? lol)

3. You get a loss in frames and/or resolution for enabling it on modern hardware. A tradeoff which is going to be a hard sell for most people. 

4. RT is the only video fidelity feature that also utilizes the CPU. For anyone that is currently CPU bottlenecked in games, RT could cause significant performance drops as their CPU is the limiting factor.


I would equate RT to a 5% increase in fidelity for a -30% decrease in perormance. That is the average scenario with modern hardware right now.
The real question is why have you bought in so much to Nvidia's marketing that you see that tradeoff as beneficial right now?

Splitting hairs unless you're a professional streamer, in which case you should probably be using a dedicated streaming PC with CPU encoding anyway. AMF encoder is more than satisfactory for most people. I agree NVENC is slightly better, and has more widespread software adoption.

> Idle power consumption on a multi monitor high refresh rate systems is a problem for a lot now, but that's not a bug itself, it's by design.

I'm not seeing this anywhere. I'm also seeing reports of Nvidia having issues with multi-monitor setups, not waking from sleep, having to disconnect/reconnect, etc. This is hardly an AMD-specific issue. It also doesn't seem to be very widespread for either AMD or Nvidia, so YMMV.

Portal rtx is a 2007 game, ofc it would be significantly different

The main advantage of RTX is mainly game development side. You don't have to rely on any sort of fancy tricks to get better looking lighting, and it's pretty much as simple as placing a light and tweaking the colors and everything

Furthermore, since you were talking about games being ""photorealistic.""

>I'm not seeing this anywhere.

lol, the net is full of the idle power consumption and it is by design, look it up (multi-monitor setups and max vram clock).

On the 7 series there is (or was) an issue with some single monitor high refresh rate monitors, there was even a known issue (or there is, I haven't followed driver changes recently).

But the max vram frequency with high refresh rate multi-monitor setups is by design since RDNA1.

And I have direct experience with this.

I never said there are no driver issues on nvidia cards.

None of which have been addressed by AMD since launch nearly 4 months ago.  The big issue with VR results is there are few reviewers who even test it.  While they will hopefully fix it eventually, I wouldn't buy a card for VR until it is.  There is no way to know how long they will take.

>Although synthetic VR benches (except for OpenVR benchmark) predicted good VR performance, we were disappointed with our 7900 XTX VR experience, unlike with pancake games. In at least two games, we experienced distracting visual artifacting and texture shimmering. The 7900 series may benefit from some attention to VR from the Radeon driver team as in many cases it even falls behind the RX 6900 XT.

From another developer:

To explain; the most important harware feature for DXR performance outside of having ray intersection accelerators is shader core performance. Rays need intersection calculations but they also need to be shaded via radiance calculations like BRDF, phong, lambert, etx. Ray intersection calculations are much faster relative to rayshading because it utilizes hardware acceleration the later is the slowest and has the biggest performance hit as it uses shader cores. Amphere has single precision FP32 shader performance that is nearly double that of RDNA2 which more than explains the performance difference in DXR games.  This advantage is only because game developers use single precision FP32 calculations to do rayshading. RDNA2 actually has a much bigger advantage in shading performance than Amphere in that RDNA2 has more that double the shader performance of amphere whe using half precision FP16. So if game developers would just switch from FP32 to FP16 in the HLSL shaders to do rayshading the performance of the RX6000 series GPUs would sharply increase by over 100% in extreme cases.",1,3/29/2023 1:55,FALSE,FALSE,What are your thoughts on value for money on current gen cards (RTX 40/RX 7000) for RT gaming?

GPUs heavily rely on multiple memory channels to handle the amount of pixel data that needs to be fed into them. You'll often see the memory interface width advertised (ie. 256-bit, 384-bit) in connection with performance. 

If you take that number and divide it by 32 you'll get the number of memory channels on the GPU (each one being a controller element and a block of cache), and for the card to perform well each channel should be attached to an equal sized ram chip.

If you look at the 12GB 3060 you'll notice that it has a 192-bit interface which means 6 channels. If you used 1GB ram chips then you'd only have 6GB. Apparently NVidia decided that 6GB wasn't enough to compete with AMD in the same segment (maybe they thought it would be enough during development and only realized when AMD released a competitor first). However the next available ram chip is 2GB so they had to go to 12GB in total. This is far from the first time someone's gotten weird memory sizes due to the number of channels.

There are two other variants. The 3060 Ti is 256-bit which means it has 8 channels and makes it easy to hit a target of 8GB exactly. There is also an 8GB varient of the 3060 however you'll notice it's only 128-bit - 2 channels are being left empty so they can use less RAM. This decreases the cost but having only 4 channels bottlenecks the card's performance compared to the 6 channel 12GB and especially the 8 channel 8GB versions.",1,3/30/2023 12:33,FALSE,FALSE,What's going on with Nvidia GPU prices?,t3_126rjun,,jeaidpx,u/nroloa,"Big corpo be greedy.

1. just because you think a video card is selling poorly, doesn't mean it actually is. news outlets and people operating on ""rumors"" (most of them outright fabrications) are wrong all the time about this. yeah maybe their buddy who works at microcenter isn't selling many video cards. But this is so far removed from the whole market that it doesn't matter. These guys get paid by the click, and if they post ""GPUs selling normally"" . . . who the fuck is gonna click that? They sensationalize everything and look for anything and everything to get you to click on their shit and give them attention.

2. We are in a weird GPU supply issue right now. There was a flood of GPUs and inventory that got piled up as Ethereum crashed last year (and eventually went POS). And it looks like Nvidia/AMD/AIBs learned their lesson not to have a fire sale on GPU inventory, and instead to reasonably manage prices and not do a race to the bottom to try and clear inventory. New GPUs are selling (4000 series and 7000 series). But old GPus are just about now clearing inventory, and these are the GPUs you hear about that have huge inventory problems.
3. It cost A TON more (3-4x) to make new video cards (7000 and 4000 series) than the older generation video cards (14/16nm video cards). The two factors that largely determine the price of a Video card are the GPU and Memory. Everyone always cites die size area when comparing teirs of cards and how much they should cost . . . Which is fine . . . If wafer prices stay the same . . . But they haven't. In addition memory prices have not really come down much since GDDR4 . . .But the amount of memory we are puting on flagship cards has jumped from 4-8gb to 12-24gb. Wafer prices have increased from 2-4k per wafer, to 10-15k per wafer. So we have the two most critical/expensive components (GPU and Memory) that have went up 3-4x for GPUs . . . So surprise surprise . . . We see a 3-4x increase in video card prices.

It used to be just shrinking the node and cramming more of the same cores in would bring major performance benefits, it still does, but it seems like it requires more effort and smarter designs as well to get there now.

My personal opinion is this generation is really just a stopgap for both companies to bring new designs and processes online, AMD seems to have got to chiplet based GPUs first but nVidia MUST have a chiplet design in the works. Their just squeezing everything they can out of a monolithic design first.

With everything that happened during the pandemic and chip shortage they will be keen to recoup every penny they can this generation. It doesn‰Ûªt help that with the mindshare that exists around nVidias top tier cards, AMD procing their cards too low would make them ‰Û÷look‰Ûª cheap and inferior even if their not too far behind.

NVidia is currently the leader, so they get to set the prices, and it‰Ûªs pretty clear they will always fuck over consumers in the name of profit. Until AMD or some other challenger takes back the crown, prices will never drop if nVidia have their way.

I'm not sure this logic applies to the vast majority of the market which is probably looking for value in the 200-600 range.

The 2080 TI was ~30% faster than the 2080 but was 60% more expensive (MSRP was fake, even Nvidia called it a 1200 dollar card in the Ampere reveal). The price difference between tiers is almost always greater the higher up you go (3050 and 3060 are closer in MSRP than 3070 and 3080 and definitely 3080 and 3090).

In this case the top end looks a lot better because the 4090 price to performance is roughly the same as that of a 4080. If this was like before where the 4080 would be 85% of 4090 (33% more money, ~15% more performance gives the same value ratio as 2080 TI vs 2080), then many people who had a budget of 1200-1700 would just get a 4080. Now those people are either buying 4090's or waiting.

Which is why the 4080 is selling horribly. The 4070 TI has a slightly better value ratio and its price is more mainstream, so it's doing better.

Plus if they have both 800+ dollar GPU's and cheaper ones, why not release both for even greater sales? The cheaper ones existing may prevent a few people from being upsold from a *still* at MSRP 3070 into a 4070 TI, but they'd also sell a lot more.

Now, you can buy for ‰âÂ300 a 3050, just to proof my case here what kind of value you get in return (a low end card vs mid range) for 1.5x the price it used to cost several years ago.

The entire gpu market is still a ripoff, while people think it's a good deal to buy a 2 year dated gpu near a jacked up MSRP on the 2nd hand market is throwing 3x salt in an open wound (as used prices for 2 year old usually is 50% or more depending on the usage and condition). Hell, I even heard and read stories from miners selling their old equipment for the same price they've bought them for, so they ran zero losses on investment + profits from mining. It's pretty self evident here who the winners and losers are.

If you can't control your emotions to buy right now to game AAA titles, then you're even better of buying a PS5 in terms of value.

I hope Intel will make a good impact on the gpu market to increase competition and better prices. I'm not too impressed with the gpu market for several years now, the perf/Watt is not as good as the relatively much cheaper cpu market's perf/Watt. Cranking up wattage to get more performance != innovation. I'll wait until '24 to see what Intel's Battlemage is going to bring on the table (so far I'm impressed by the A770, pretty good value (the hardware and features like hevc + av1 encoder) on paper. The only thing what's preventing me to buy one yet is the high power consumption in idle and perf/Watt, otherwise I'd have bought it if the price would be around $/‰âÂ300-350. I've already read the workaround messing with aspm's powerstates, but that option is not available on my motherboard, plus, I'm running multi monitor setup where that fix does not count and 2 nvme ssd's that rely on pci-e, so messing with the aspm powerstates is not always a smart thing to do.

TL;DR; The gpu market is still messed up and overpriced as of now. When affordable mid-mid high end become available, price/perf and perf/Watt improves above small margins year-on-year, I'll reconsider.

If nvidia and amd can stay afloat since they don't need to rely on gpus, does that mean they don't need to budge their increasing prices which at this rate it will never end? I assume they won't lower any 4000 gen card price til next gen late 2024 despite not many people buying the 4070ti in 2023 so far as shown by the availability since they can afford to keep inventory.

Budget gamers who expect 1000 series value won't be getting that anymore in the future.

Once the budget 1600 and 6600 cards are gone they would just keep selling at msrp $300+ gpus in the future. Nvidia and amd would start increasing entry level gpus by a hundred each gen with a $300 4050, $400 5050 and so on until no more gamers feel its worth the money.

I guess if there was value, it was the 1000s, 3080, and amd similar counterparts.

Frankly I'm more worried AMD will price itself right out of the market regardless of MCM advantages. AMD's market share is floating between 8-15% depending on where you look and despite the even worse value of budget NVIDIA cards AMD reportedly is still losing share. Intel is here to stay and not afraid to offer good value on the low end, so simply existing as the ""not NVIDIA"" option will no longer keep AMD in the market. I haven't even mentioned the ""value"" of the $200 6500XT yet.

From my own experience, I don't know any gamer in real life having bought it, except IT professionals who have the need for CUDA cores.

The difference between work requirements vs gaming needs to be taking in to consideration, as those gpu's are assets when they generate income (whether it was mining or the need for other work that relies on them) vs consuming (i.e. gaming).  
For example, if you mined with a 3090 during the last 6 months of the peak, you'd got your ROI back. Now compare that to a gamer who doesn't make any money from it and upgrades each 2 years => ‰âÂ2000 4090 / 24 months = ‰âÂ83,33 writeoff for the gpu alone and half of that for 4 years. This is very hard to justify for modal income for gamers in even the western world where buying power right now is at levels since the great depression for the first time, whereas it was a good deal for a miner.

We're now in a situation we were in 2008 as well with AMD and Nvidia, which were sued for pricefixing and settled before it went to court. Shortly after, the big crash happened and prices went below MSRP significantly until repriced MSRP for the next gen was over half of previous. The economy is in a similiar situation as in 2008 as well, ironically, with Bern Bernanke recently calling for a soft landing, which they (the banksters) had publically declared as well in dec 2006. We all know what happened.

This also happened with the DDR4 market (pricefixing, until the FSC stepped in and magically prices went down since).

Everything in life happens in cycles, so the high price schemes will not last. I expect no real price decreases (other than discounts on 2x prices is still overpriced) until 2024 (optimistically) and most probably 2025. Intel can stir the pot up heavily with the Battlemage in Q1-Q2 '24 if priced right. Until then, AMD and Nvidia are milking gamers dry.

Even if in the worst case scenario possible, which is highly unlikely, but prices will increasing each gen with $100, then we might see more powerful APU's/iGPU's coming in the low-mid range eventually, because the entire gaming industry would then be severely limited (as a trickle down effect in the medium-long term) so they have to adapt to certain predefined standards to work on, such as console market are right now. This would be bad, because we could end up in a situation where we move to SoC and the freedom to choose parts will then be severely limited (like you have with consoles, nucs or even worse, smarthpones.

Another thing to consider is that there are many people looking for an affordable upgrade. The steam survey proves it, many people are still on a 1060. The many reddit and youtube comments also give indication of this. So even if there are truly good deals, they probably will all sellout before you have a change.

If you're in need right now with budget $250-300, the A750 looks promising if you can stomach the well known issues, otherwise AMD's 6600-6700 and simply nothing from Nvidia (well, you can buy bad perf/price if you want to buy 250-300 low end that is worse than the 200 for the 1060 6gb). If you can wait, then def do, like me.

Personally, I'd not buy second hand (especially mined ones), but I can imagine many budget constraint people might look for this route (be careful what you buy), although prices are still too high even there. I can clearly the see controlled selling there not to dump prices by miners (selling several cards at once with hundreds of reviews in the last months selling their inventory) below the usual 33-50% of msrp on 2 year old gpu's. Also, I ethically oppose buying from miners.  
It's best to wait for next gen and then buy 4000/7000 series if you go this second hand route, to not buy a mined dud and probably have better 2nd hand prices as well.  


TL;DR; If you're budget restraint, wait 1-2 years. If you can't and want to upgrade in 2 years, then buy the cheapest available thing that will serve you, because for 300, you can't buy a ps5 either or limit the games you're playing (instead of AAA games, maybe games like Rimworld or Hearts of Iron IV or even Company of Heroes 3, being released today, doesn't require that much).

And here's 4700S's multi- and single- thread [comparison](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/3481vs3238vs4309/AMD-Ryzen-5-3600-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-2700X-vs-AMD-4700S) with the 3600 and 2700X.

The 2700X beats 4700S slightly in ST in this synthetic measurement, but loses slightly in MT. On the whole 2700X appears to be very close to PS5, even closer than 3600. Ever so slightly behind the PS5 CPU imho, considering the MT performance.

For a desktop to run games primarily designed for PS5 and then ported over to PC, I'd pick a slightly more powerful CPU than an exact equivalent to allow for losing the PS5 optimization, and for a performance penalty of porting.

My big issue is that the 6400 and 6500 XT SUCK yet are still $150-200. 

The 6400 should be like $100, and a card like the 6500 XT should be like $130. And then there should be another card between a 6500 XT and a 6600 (say, 3050 level) that costs around $170ish. 

Also, a 16% margin is A LOT as I just demonstrated, the article said that 5% is a low margin, 10% is a ""healthy"" margin, and 20 is ""high.""

They're making good money and can afford to lower prices at 16%.

My first GPU ever was a HD 3650. I'd classify that as roughly a modern equivalent of like....a modern 6500 XT give or take, given they had the 3450 which was even lower tier.

The 3650 was a $75 card. I spent $80 on it. Plugging in the MSRP into an inflation calculator, I get $104.

As I said, the minimum I'd recommend getting is the 6500 XT or 1650 for $170, and I'd personally recommend a 6600 or 6650 XT which get 3060 type performance for significantly less. 

It's only nvidia who has such insane GPU prices. The 6650 XT and Arc A750 both run circles around the 3050 for the most part. 

The thing is, this sub is horribly out of touch with what it considers budget. This is because it's a bunch of upper class white collar professionals who make $75k+ a year doing programming and web development, and graphic design, and often have tons of money to burn. 

So they buy these grossly overpriced GPUs, play at 4k, and think not playing at max settings with ray tracing is unacceptable.

And then they look at us normal 1080p gamers still getting by on mid 5 figure household income and buying $250 GPUs LIKE WE ALWAYS DID as if we are the poors. 

And looking at your attitude, you're just about as bad as the stereotype i pointed out. 

And btw, Im not saying that this level of performance is acceptable for the price either. Quite frankly given how the 6600, Arc A750, and 6650 XT perform for around $250, the prices on the lower cards are WAAAY out of whack.

If we had the same price/performance down the stack, the 1650/6500 XT would be closer to $125-150, the 6400 should be $100, the 1630 would be $75 (seriously, it's on par with the 1050 I mentioned that started at $110), and the 1030 should be like a $40 card. 

The fact that so little progress has happened in 6 years is concerning, and I fear for the TRUE budget segment (which I'd define as around $150 for ""serious"" gamers, those are your traditional ""50"" series buyers). 

But seriously, $250 is your normal middle of the road ""60"" buyers before nvidia decided ""lol, let's charge $350-400"". 

And at this point, given where the market is right now, yeah, this is an NVIDIA problem. Both Intel and AMD have solid offerings for $250. a 6600 will run any game out there at 60 FPS at 1080p on AT LEAST medium, and most on high, if not ultra. It's really the crazy new 2023 releases that make me say ""medium"" given hardware requirements are inflating at a startling rate, but yeah. 

This isn't abnormal for typical midrange buyers though. I traditionally gamed at 900p on like medium-high with your typical $250 card and held onto it for about 5 years on average (4-6 is the typical GPU lifespan). I only went up to 1080p with the 1060. 

And now for some reason rich guys on this sub think that that's minimum and budget and for the poors. No, you guys are just out of touch. 1080p is the most popular monitor size, 720p is probably more popular than 4k in practice, most people game at 60 hz. Etc.

Technically PCs do cost more. No PC part is sold at a loss while consoles are. Console profit comes from inflated game prices and online pay (which are a good reason to get a PC instead but that's not what we are talking about here). Maybe you can cheap out on some things like an HDD rather than a TB M2, get rid of wifi, weaker PSU (most of the times this translates into not reliable for more than a year if stable at all under high consumption) and still have a more powerful machine. But logistically speaking, consoles are in fact cheaper for what they bring. 

Also when you say ""You can get a much better PC if you use used parts"", do you account for used consoles prices as well? Or are you comparing apples with oranges?",1,4/2/2023 4:51,FALSE,FALSE,Why are graphic card prices still so high if they are not selling?,t1_j8x18gf,,jptq29u,u/bondjavel,"I‰Ûªm late, but on top of what has already been mentioned, you‰Ûªre missing some other things here.

They ALL additionally support raytracing on aforementioned resolutions at aforementioned framerates. All on a small form factor and while running on a measly 500 watts during gaming sessions. 

If you‰Ûªre into VR, having a PS5 also makes it possible to get PSVR2, which provides some of the most immersive VR gaming in the consumer market at some of the most affordable prices. It even competes with the upcoming Quest 3, which is insane. 


You don‰Ûªt get this stuff on equivalently priced PCs, even when they‰Ûªre homebuilt on used components. Consoles have won when it comes to bang-for-your-buck gaming, and it will likely stay that way. The fact that the entire rig is assembled in factories lowers costs. Game/engine devs and other software engineers keep your your very specific specs in mind when optimizing, which leaves you with performances that PCs with similar hardware are too software-limited to match.

The fact that you get to build it yourself is a wonderful feature, granted that you enjoy it which plenty don‰Ûªt. Its customisability allows users to personalise it in both appearance and performance, which is something that console users miss out on entirely. May be other advantages that didn‰Ûªt come to mind.

Most inflation is actually driven by corporate greed.

LTT actually had tier list of the past 20 years of nvidia GPUs and I did my own take on them, and uh...yeah, what nvidia has been doing the past 3 generations is ahistorical and bonkers.

I mean, you're right, this stuff actually is political, and political outlook will define how you see it.

>Here is is folks. The delusions stated outright. 

As I said, this is political, you're right wing. 

>Video cards are a first world luxury good. Cry me a river about how poor people can't afford them to play their games for which they oldy have lots of free time while scavenging for resources in their own poverty. Save the bullshit. We're not talking about cheap used cars for commuting to work. We're talking bout the video card equivalent of high end sports cars. 

Ah yes, the poors shouldnt have access to GPUs. They should just work harder. Only true hard working upper class americans deserve those GPUs. 

You know how delusional you sound when i cut through the ideological bullcrap? Jesus christ this is why i crap on this sub's demographics so much. 

>I'm not a right winger. I've not expressed my specific political views. But you would think so because by your own admission, your ideology clouds your judgment. Way to show your ass by calling me something I'm not.

Given your assumptions on things like inflation, attacking people who disagree with you as leftists, and what you said comparing GPUs to sports cars...yeah I have some bad news for you, buddy...

>No one is forced to buy. Thus one can't be screwed. This is basic logic.

Then you go without. Hooray for pricing people out of the market!

Really, market fundamentalism is a cancer here.

>And none of that mattera because you don't know what's really going on. You know. Your view being shaped by your political ideology..

So is yours. At least im honest and admit it, and wish we could have this conversation on this sub more often. Sorry you dont like having your views challenged.

EDIT: LMFAO he blocked me, my response:

> The ONLY way inflation happens is via government injecting money into the economy. Our currency is centrally managed. This is not disputable.

Yes it is, but that's an extremely simplistic way to look at it. Things also matter like unemployment rate, supply shortages, corporate greed, etc. We just shut down and reopened the entire world economy for a year. The entire WORLD is experiencing inflation. Doing that shocks the entire world economy dude. It's not like a computer. if your computer screws up, turning it off and on again often fixes it. Do that to an economy and it screws it up, because its a complex well managed machine and turning it off and on again knocks the variables out of whack. 

>I never said they should not. I'm saying your dumbass stance on the issue is as of it's like a fundamental good for life and prosperity. It's not and neither are video games. So frame me out to be anti-poor, because that's what people like you do. You delude yourself that because you're poor and can't afford a new high end GPU, that the problem is everything else but you. It's childish and shallow.

Hint, it's not just the ""high end"", it's the entire market. Historically, GPUs ranged from around $100 up to around $500-700. Heck going all the way back to the 2000s was wild as I remember GPUs down as low as like $50. 

The 1650 is freaking $170, and it's 4 years old. ""60"" cards went from costing $200-300 up to $350-400. That's the ""bread and butter"" GPU. Im not talking that enthusiast crap. The cheapest ""current gen"" card is the ""$250"" (reallty $300) 3050. And in 6 years we've only seen about a 50% increase in performance epr dollar, with 2/3 of that happening 4 years ago with the 16 series. 

The entire budget GPU market is more or less GONE. $150-180 is entry level now. That's your RX 6400s and 1650s. And if not for AMD, we old 1060 and 580 owners would LITERALLY HAVE NO UPGRADE PATH. Youre in your own little world going on about ""luxury GPUs"" and sports cars and blah blah blah.

here I'm seeing people priced out of the market entirely. Theres a reason the 1060 is still one of the top cards on steam hardware survey. And the 1650...replaced it? That's WORSE! Seriously, how do you not understand that this market is just BROKEN? Full on broken.

So yeah I am gonna crap on your views here since it really does seem to reek of the typical elitism I see on these hardware subs. About 5-10 years ago it used to be full of people looking to typically spend $500-1000 on a computer. An ENTIRE COMPUTER.

Your typical PC 10 years ago was like a i5 2500k with a 760 or something. And people were still buying FX CPUs and i3s and mixing them when 750 tis and stuff. 

Again, these people are being full on PRICED OUT of the market. That's BAD. Well, unless you're a snotty elitist who doesnt care about affordable PC gaming, which sounds like half this sub sometimes. 

>That's exactly what it is right? You're broke so you're mad and blame them for being anti-poor and gatekeeping you. What an insanely narcissistic view. Guess what. They don't give a shit about your economic status. If they can get you to buy, and your market segment profitable enough, then you'll have an option.

Ah yes, more poor shaming. And yes, by your standard i AM poor. And apparently i dont deserve to game and should work harder or some crap. 

Again, you might not like having your views challenged, but you're an economic right winger. 

>You've done literally nothing to challenge me. You were easily baited into revealing your far left bias and it's obvious you were triggered. You're triggered because you felt personally slighted. Classic narcissistic toxic left wing bullshit. You can't handle that I exist on here so you feel the need to attack me personally. It's pathetic and does your ideology no favors.

Hint, you dont need to bait me to show my bias. I wear it on my sleeve. Anyone who checks my profile can see Im fairly left wing. At least by capitalist standards. The amount of gatekeeping i get from actual anti capitalist leftists is astounding. But yeah, according to you, the mere suggestion that markets should work for the people and we shouldnt have to spend $300 on an entry level bottom of the barrel GPU apparently makes me a pinko commie. 

I really couldnt give a crap what someone of your ideological persuasion thinks of me, because i quite frankly stopped giving a crap what the ""right"" thinks about, well...anything any more. 

But yeah, you ARE right wing, whether you'll admit it or not. As is most of this sub. And that bias is insufferable on here sometimes.
