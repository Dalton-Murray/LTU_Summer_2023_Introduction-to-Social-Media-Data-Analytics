Graphics cards are not like SSDs and RAM where the price fluctuates like your usual commodity, which means Nvidia and AMD signed off on these price drops to some extent.\n\nWe're currently in a state of consumer chip oversupply, so patient gamers can probably expect some more price drops in the short term. However, there are already rumors that Nvidia (no word yet on AMD) is set to reduce production of consumer chips in order to better match the cold demand for graphics cards. That means the discount party is going to end at some point.\n\nHow exactly it ends is hard to predict. It could be that prices will raise back up to MSRP once the undersupply meets the under-demand. Personally, I think Nvidia and AMD will just let these discounts stay the way they are and just replace existing SKUs with \"Super\" refreshes. The \"Super\" SKUs will set a brand new MSRP that are more likely to hold due to no longer being oversupplied, and the existing discounted SKUs will eventually sell out.",

In these cases of tiebreaker it is a pretty big lean in Nvidia\u2019s favor.\n\n[According to HUB\u2019s video on the topic,](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy3ikm8MxOM) the 6950XT is 15% faster at 1440p and that\u2019s significantly less than the amount that DLSS Quality adds (while maintaining roughly native quality output), and FSR2 Quality mode has bad output at 1440p. If you are willing to take the quality loss from using FSR2 quality mode for a 20-30% bump, DLSS2 performance mode will bump the DLSS increase to more like 50% and it utterly blows the 6950XT away at equal visual quality again. That\u2019s the situation AMD finds themselves in competing against DLSS, their cards really need to be delivering around 30% more raw raster to keep up with the image quality loss from FSR2 in the 1080p and 1440p segments given how bad FSR2 is at those resolutions. Dlss2 quality is roughly on par with native (often better, actually), it\u2019s essentially free frames, and FSR2 is **not**, especially at 1080p and 1440p where it\u2019s rather poor.\n\nIf you think of upscaling like an op-amp\u2026 there is a gain ratio and AMD cards are simply much noisier for a given gain ratio. So they need to be offering a stronger input signal to offset that, because to the end user it doesn\u2019t matter - stronger input vs cleaner gain is an implementation detail, all they care is that it sounds the same. And nvidia has got it to the point where their first setting of gain doesn't add any noise, and if you don\u2019t want the gain you can choose DLAA and get cleaner-than-native output for free instead. That\u2019s the marketing problem AMD faces in the 1080p and 1440p segments. Also, all of this applies to intel as well, their XeSS is much closer to DLSS2 than FSR2, AMD is significantly behind *both* competitors.\n\nLet alone any kind of perf/w comparison\u2026. 6950XT consumes 200W more power to get that 15% native res win, and cost 5% more, at the time of their video (it\u2019s gone up a bit more since as stock depletes).  And DLSS doesn't really increase the card power, the TDP budget is what it is and the framerate is what it is.  It's a cheap way to render more frames per watt and more frames period.  Laptop dGPU is a dying segment but DLSS is absolutely a must-have if you are buying a gaming laptop imo.  Ada is pushing like 2x the native perf/w of RDNA2, and with DLSS piled in that rises to like, 250-300% of the perf/w of RDNA2 dGPUs.\n\nYes, the 6950XT has 4GB more but the 4070 isn\u2019t up against the wall in the same way the 8gb cards are. Series S has 8GB of VRAM and series X has 10GB, so, it\u2019s probably not going to massively massively increase such that 12gb is unplayable.\n\nIt\u2019s arguable but at equal price the balance really does tip towards the 4070, even Steve is onboard with that one. If you can get a 6800XT for $450 or $500 then whatever but the era of paying $600-700 for Navi 21 is really drawing to a close. Giving up DLSS and/or suffering through FSR2 1440p at 200w more power and 5% higher cost for a 10% performance advantage and 4GB more vram really is not worth it in the big picture.\n\n4070 is a legit decent card, it\u2019s just not a return to Moores law era progress. The 3080 and 3060 ti were the value peak of the lineup and struggled to reach msrp, 4070 being a more efficient 3080 12gb for $100 less really is not bad. With the $100 microcenter steam GC deal it\u2019s actually pretty great, 4070 12gb for de facto $500 is about as good as things are going to get this gen. Yes, not as good a deal as 1070 or 970, but things are different now.",

        "body": "> most stores like Mindfactory don't sell / ship to other Europe countries.\n\nThat is mostly a shipping cost and legal issue with scammers. Shipping inside of Germany is dirt cheap with DHL. The moment you cross the border even by one meter, that price really jumps up a lot. \n\nNow combine that with a very active community of thief's that use stolen PayPal, visa, and other payment methods to buy items. By the time it's get flagged as stolen, the seller is eating that cost because if you want to report the issue, well, good luck dealing with French of Romanian police. I also do not like it but as long as our justice system is so fragmented in Europe, well ...\n\nThe issue is also, lets say they ship to Belgium. Maybe they have less problem with scammers there, but if you ship to Belgium, the next guy in Romania can say \"hey, you are discriminating my EU country\" (what technically is correct, it is a form of discrimination and that is against some EU laws of goods sold in EU). So, it became \"We simply ship to nobody\".\n\nMy father yeaaaars ago dealt with a Polish seller for some wood stove. He wanted to buy directly from Poland (and pay shipping). They said: \"No, we have a distributor in your country, you need to use him\". \n\nExcept that guy was asking like 50% more for the exact same thing, that this distributor needed to order from ... Poland. Dad fed up (and stubborn as a mule) contacted EU and said, \"hey, they are selling these products across border using a distributor, that means i can order directly from them\". Yep, EU agreed, and Polish shop needed to sell directly. And if you only sell inside your own country, well, EU cannot force you to sell outside your country, but if you have a network or selective sell outside, then you need to sell to ALL EU countries.\n\nSo i hope this explains a few things...\n\n> May I ask what do you use to sell / buy used instead of Ebay?\n\nFor the bulk is still Ebay, they still have the best buy protection, sell protection is kind of iffy and i always advice people to document EVERYTHING. Your good working, take picture, put them in box, pictures, packaging, pictures, label, pictures...

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>most stores like Mindfactory don&#39;t sell / ship to other Europe countries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is mostly a shipping cost and legal issue with scammers. Shipping inside of Germany is dirt cheap with DHL. The moment you cross the border even by one meter, that price really jumps up a lot. </p>\n\n<p>Now combine that with a very active community of thief&#39;s that use stolen PayPal, visa, and other payment methods to buy items. By the time it&#39;s get flagged as stolen, the seller is eating that cost because if you want to report the issue, well, good luck dealing with French of Romanian police. I also do not like it but as long as our justice system is so fragmented in Europe, well ...</p>\n\n<p>The issue is also, lets say they ship to Belgium. Maybe they have less problem with scammers there, but if you ship to Belgium, the next guy in Romania can say &quot;hey, you are discriminating my EU country&quot; (what technically is correct, it is a form of discrimination and that is against some EU laws of goods sold in EU). So, it became &quot;We simply ship to nobody&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>My father yeaaaars ago dealt with a Polish seller for some wood stove. He wanted to buy directly from Poland (and pay shipping). They said: &quot;No, we have a distributor in your country, you need to use him&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Except that guy was asking like 50% more for the exact same thing, that this distributor needed to order from ... Poland. Dad fed up (and stubborn as a mule) contacted EU and said, &quot;hey, they are selling these products across border using a distributor, that means i can order directly from them&quot;. Yep, EU agreed, and Polish shop needed to sell directly. And if you only sell inside your own country, well, EU cannot force you to sell outside your country, but if you have a network or selective sell outside, then you need to sell to ALL EU countries.</p>\n\n<p>So i hope this explains a few things...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>May I ask what do you use to sell / buy used instead of Ebay?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the bulk is still Ebay, they still have the best buy protection, sell protection is kind of iffy and i always advice people to document EVERYTHING. Your good working, take picture, put them in box, pictures, packaging, pictures, label, pictures... Really helps with issue buyers.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just a lot less people then in the past so it takes longer to sell items. </p>\n\n<p>Part of the issue with affordable hardware is, people simply do not bother selling on eBay and throw stuff in a corner.

So, it became \"We simply ship to nobody\".\n\nThis is also not true. You can discriminate countries and indeed you do so.

And everyone is just so primed for \"new cards are bad, don't buy\" that even actual good deals just don't penetrate the hivemind.  It drove me nuts that people didn't think the microcenter deal (effectively $500 for a 4070) was even very good, like that was just \"ok\" to people.  That was actually an amazing deal and the alternative is going to be shit like the 4060 Ti 16GB.  People aren't going to like whatever Navi 32 product AMD farts out at that price segment either.\n\nPeople also love to do comparisons against the 3060 Ti MSRP which was literally never at MSRP until like a month ago, or mix and match the 3080 10GB (cheaper, smaller VRAM) against the 3080 12GB (no official MSRP), and the 4070 really is the best of both worlds and also $100 cheaper.  Same for 4060/Ti, people start compare against the 3070 performance and mixing that with the 3060 Ti price and then whining that it doesn't stack a bunch of additional improvement on top of that.  4060 Ti is still mediocre but 4060 being 3060 Ti perf for $300 is really pretty great actually, you're 25% cheaper than the very best card in the 30-series lineup that literally never hit MSRP until like two months ago because it was too damn cheap for partners to want to make it.\n\nFWIW I do feel that 7900XT has really gotten the pitchfork brigade unfairly too.  Yes, bad card at $900.  At $700 it's getting down into reasonableness - although it still has the same struggles around FSR/DLSS except at 4K.  But I just don't think AMD cares, they can't reasonably fix it without some kind of ML core, so they're just gonna cater to the \"native res is the only res\" crowd.\n\nOn the other hand, I also am not expecting much from the Navi 32 cards.  I think like the 7600 they're basically going to slot in over the prices of their RDNA2 performance equivalents, while being weaker in some ways.  Again, like, whatever N32 AMD slots at $500 is not going to be better than a 6800XT, it's gonna be similar-ish but generally a cheaper weaker card that leans on the RDNA3 gimmicks to hold performance up, just like NVIDIA leans on DLSS to hold performance up.  Just like 7600 didn't blow away a 6600XT either.\n\nThat's always the tradeoff when you go from a high-end previous gen model to a midrange current-gen model... like 1080 Ti vs 2070/2070S.  The 2070 has a lot of numbers that are lower than the 1080 Ti, because it's using the architectural improvements to push the cost downwards instead of push the performance upwards.  It's a weaker card that tries to get more out of the performance it's got, and that makes it cheaper.  But people want number to go up, forever, and honestly that's not *quite* how it worked even in the glory days.  970 has less raw memory bandwidth than 780 Ti, and so on.

I really don't get this strategy.\n\nI think it's to avoid the 2070 Super/4070 Ti response.  If they actually *announce* a way lower MSRP then NVIDIA will cut the prices immediately.  If they overprice it and let it float down organically, I think the sense is that NVIDIA generally doesn't care about that.  I don\u2019t understand why nvidia treats it differently but it seems like they do.\n\nYou can see like the 7900XT vs the 4080/4070 Ti... when AMD launches the 7900XT/XTX then NVIDIA immediately launches the 4070 Ti in response, but if they just keep letting the XT float downwards *hundreds of dollars*, nothing.  Same for 3060 vs 6600/6600XT/6700XT, or 3070 vs 6800/6800XT/6950XT... AMD just floats the prices right on down and NVIDIA studiously ignores it.  And of course the classic 5700XT leading to Super, 290X leading to 780 Ti, etc.\n\nSo they take it on the chin in reviews, but they get the actual sales out of it.  Yeah, it'd be better to get both, but, they kinda can't get both.  The only thing they get from that is lower margins.\n\nAnd I do think margins are getting to be more of an issue in the low end than people think.  PHYs don't shrink and are starting to dominate the area of low-end cards, that's why they kept N33 on 6nm too.  Launch at $279, sell at $200, OK, but they can't afford to launch at $200, have NVIDIA respond, and be forced down to $149 or whatever on an 8GB card.",
