They have inventory worth several bn, if it doesn't sell, they'll have no option but to clear stock at reduced prices but that may take a while.

Intel could be it, but I guess that as soon as they get some traction they will just act like nVidia and AMD do.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I can see happening, is that another smaller player can start producing GPUs using cheaper and older nodes. No need to be in the latest node for a GPU to be good.</p>\n\n<p>Of course it will not compete with the latest nVidia and AMD offerings, but they should be cheaper. The problem is that as long as developers keep releasing unoptimised games hoping that we can power through their issues, many people will keep arguing that you need a 4090 or you are not entitled to play.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I have enough backlog for centuries so I can keep using my 3070 Ti forever. I do not feel any FOMO with new releases so power to me.</p>\n</div>",

It inspired me to look into what is actually involved in optimizing a game and my non-expert understanding is that it mostly comes down to ensuring that the game only loads things that are immediately noticeable to the player, e.g. textures for things the player is currently looking at or only modelling AI behaviour for NPCs in the immediate proximity. This allows most of the resources to be dedicated to what's currently on screen vs what's 'behind' the screen and in the distance. \n\nThis is also *incredibly* difficult and time consuming to do without things like loading screens or the player noticing pop-in etc. It's also something that has diminishing returns, meaning actual optimization comes down to how consistent the game is at running on the intended hardware vs how long it would take to improve that performance. It's why some games force you to slow down in certain areas or why 90% of game time in the original Mass Effect was spent riding elevators on the citadel; it allows things to load in the background without having to look at an actual loading screen. \n\nMy (again, non-expert) impression of performance issues with the Last of Us is that it has something to do with how inefficiently the game allocates textures to VRAM. It was built for the PS5 which has amazing storage/memory capabilities not yet available on PCs and thus the game is fundamentally designed around not loading things the way most PC games do.

Yeah you might save some money, but the amount you save is small, usually less than a meal out.</p>\n\n<p>I advise a lot of people not to buy the F models either. Sure you might save, at most, $20. But if your GPU dies, most people would gladly pay the difference just to be able to continue using the PC while they sort out a replacement GPU.</p>\n\n<p>Might as well just get the chip with the iGPU in the first place.</p>\n</div>",
