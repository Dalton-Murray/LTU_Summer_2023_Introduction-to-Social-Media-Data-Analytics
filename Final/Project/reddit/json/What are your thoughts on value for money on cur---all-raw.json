There are more important things right now than a technology in its infancy. Maybe 6000 Nvidia and 9000 AMD cards will be strong enough. I traded my 3070 ti for an RX 6800, and all I can say is that I&#39;m happy I did. 3070 ti may do better RT, however meaningless and insignificant, 6800 is better in raster. Plus, due to higher VRAM, it does RT better in some games where 3070 ti can run out of VRAM.</p>\n</div>",
