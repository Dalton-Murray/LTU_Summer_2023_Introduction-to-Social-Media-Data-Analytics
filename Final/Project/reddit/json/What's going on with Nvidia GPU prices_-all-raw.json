      "selftext": "Been running a 1080 Ti since release, but its starting to feel its age a bit, so I figure its time to upgrade.\n\nI was looking at Nvidia cards with 10+ GB VRAM. Most of them are like $1-2k. And then there's the 3060 with 12 GB at $300-400.\n\nWhat's going on there? Is there something about the architecture that fucks with its performance? Is there some quirk that makes it bad for mining?\n\n---\n\nI'm only looking at Nvidia cards; I need cuda for machine learning. Been something like a 70-30 gaming-ML split lately.\n\nUS market, budget undefined.\n\n\n---\n\nEDIT: it seems people are ***wildly misunderstanding my question***.\n\nI don't care about corporate greed. I want to know why the 3060 is so much cheaper than other 30XX and 40XX cards *to this day*, even though it has a pretty massive amount of VRAM by comparison.\n\n**Why is the 3060 so cheap *still*?**\n\nIs there something wrong with it? Would I be shooting myself in the foot by getting it over something like a 3080 TI or a 40XX card with 10-12 GB?",
