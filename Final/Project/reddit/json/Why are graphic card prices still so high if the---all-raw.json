Now compare that to a gamer who doesn't make any money from it and upgrades each 2 years => \u20ac2000 4090 / 24 months = \u20ac83,33 writeoff for the gpu alone and half of that for 4 years. This is very hard to justify for modal income for gamers in even the western world where buying power right now is at levels since the great depression for the first time, whereas it was a good deal for a miner.\n\nWe're now in a situation we were in 2008 as well with AMD and Nvidia, which were sued for pricefixing and settled before it went to court. Shortly after, the big crash happened and prices went below MSRP significantly until repriced MSRP for the next gen was over half of previous. The economy is in a similiar situation as in 2008 as well, ironically, with Bern Bernanke recently calling for a soft landing, which they (the banksters) had publically declared as well in dec 2006. We all know what happened.\n\nThis also happened with the DDR4 market (pricefixing, until the FSC stepped in and magically prices went down since).\n\nEverything in life happens in cycles, so the high price schemes will not last. I expect no real price decreases (other than discounts on 2x prices is still overpriced) until 2024 (optimistically) and most probably 2025. Intel can stir the pot up heavily with the Battlemage in Q1-Q2 '24 if priced right. Until then, AMD and Nvidia are milking gamers dry.\n\nEven if in the worst case scenario possible, which is highly unlikely, but prices will increasing each gen with $100, then we might see more powerful APU's/iGPU's coming in the low-mid range eventually, because the entire gaming industry would then be severely limited (as a trickle down effect in the medium-long term) so they have to adapt to certain predefined standards to work on, such as console market are right now. This would be bad, because we could end up in a situation where we move to SoC and the freedom to choose parts will then be severely limited (like you have with consoles, nucs or even worse, smarthpones.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that there are many people looking for an affordable upgrade. The steam survey proves it, many people are still on a 1060. The many reddit and youtube comments also give indication of this. So even if there are truly good deals, they probably will all sellout before you have a change.\n\nIf you're in need right now with budget $250-300, the A750 looks promising if you can stomach the well known issues, otherwise AMD's 6600-6700 and simply nothing from Nvidia (well, you can buy bad perf/price if you want to buy 250-300 low end that is worse than the 200 for the 1060 6gb). If you can wait, then def do, like me.\n\nPersonally, I'd not buy second hand (especially mined ones), but I can imagine many budget constraint people might look for this route (be careful what you buy), although prices are still too high even there. I can clearly the see controlled selling there not to dump prices by miners (selling several cards at once with hundreds of reviews in the last months selling their inventory) below the usual 33-50% of msrp on 2 year old gpu's. Also, I ethically oppose buying from miners.  \nIt's best to wait for next gen and then buy 4000/7000 series if you go this second hand route, to not buy a mined dud and probably have better 2nd hand prices as well.  \n\n\nTL;DR; If you're budget restraint, wait 1-2 years. If you can't and want to upgrade in 2 years, then buy the cheapest available thing that will serve you, because for 300, you can't buy a ps5 either or limit the games you're playing (instead of AAA games, maybe games like Rimworld or Hearts of Iron IV or even Company of Heroes 3, being released today, doesn't require that much). \n\nThe good times will come back, it just will take time as always, best to take a break from checking prices each day/week and be happy what you got right now, would be what I'd do if I were in this situation.",

Quite frankly given how the 6600, Arc A750, and 6650 XT perform for around $250, the prices on the lower cards are WAAAY out of whack.\n\nIf we had the same price/performance down the stack, the 1650/6500 XT would be closer to $125-150, the 6400 should be $100, the 1630 would be $75 (seriously, it's on par with the 1050 I mentioned that started at $110), and the 1030 should be like a $40 card. \n\nThe fact that so little progress has happened in 6 years is concerning, and I fear for the TRUE budget segment (which I'd define as around $150 for \"serious\" gamers, those are your traditional \"50\" series buyers). \n\nBut seriously, $250 is your normal middle of the road \"60\" buyers before nvidia decided \"lol, let's charge $350-400\". \n\nAnd at this point, given where the market is right now, yeah, this is an NVIDIA problem. Both Intel and AMD have solid offerings for $250. a 6600 will run any game out there at 60 FPS at 1080p on AT LEAST medium, and most on high, if not ultra. It's really the crazy new 2023 releases that make me say \"medium\" given hardware requirements are inflating at a startling rate, but yeah. \n\nThis isn't abnormal for typical midrange buyers though. I traditionally gamed at 900p on like medium-high with your typical $250 card and held onto it for about 5 years on average (4-6 is the typical GPU lifespan).

        "body": ">it\u2019s a misconception to say that pcs cost more.\n\nTechnically PCs do cost more. No PC part is sold at a loss while consoles are.

Yeah 30 bucks for Wi-Fi is fair though frankly most gamers don\u2019t use Wi-Fi (my brother won\u2019t even use it on his laptop for gaming some bs about latency\u2026sigh). An ssd is going to cost 50 bucks. Mean while the ps5 is literally only good for content consumption. You can\u2019t create anything on it not even a word document, it can barely browse the internet and so on. You give up portability for versatility. Very frankly the 3060ti will slaughter the ps5, particularly if you do put Linux on it. Plus I literally searched for one item and hit sort by lowest price then picked things I thought would be reasonably capable. I didn\u2019t cross shop, I didn\u2019t bang for the buck (you can still get ryzen 3600s new for less than the 5500 I linked for instance). Shopping smarter will bring the price down a good bit. It can be done.</p>\n</div>",

With some premium offers now around 45\u20ac I think; and we had more budget offers as low as 20\u20ac I think.</p>\n\n<p>And that was with the national state owned phone company owning all the last mile network, almost all points of presence, and charging as much as possible everyone and everything.</p>\n</div>",

Sorry you dont like having your views challenged.\n\nEDIT: LMFAO he blocked me, my response:\n\n> The ONLY way inflation happens is via government injecting money into the economy. Our currency is centrally managed. This is not disputable.\n\nYes it is, but that's an extremely simplistic way to look at it. Things also matter like unemployment rate, supply shortages, corporate greed, etc. We just shut down and reopened the entire world economy for a year. The entire WORLD is experiencing inflation. Doing that shocks the entire world economy dude. It's not like a computer. if your computer screws up, turning it off and on again often fixes it. Do that to an economy and it screws it up, because its a complex well managed machine and turning it off and on again knocks the variables out of whack. \n\n>I never said they should not. I'm saying your dumbass stance on the issue is as of it's like a fundamental good for life and prosperity. It's not and neither are video games. So frame me out to be anti-poor, because that's what people like you do. You delude yourself that because you're poor and can't afford a new high end GPU, that the problem is everything else but you. It's childish and shallow.\n\nHint, it's not just the \"high end\", it's the entire market. Historically, GPUs ranged from around $100 up to around $500-700. Heck going all the way back to the 2000s was wild as I remember GPUs down as low as like $50. \n\nThe 1650 is freaking $170, and it's 4 years old. \"60\" cards went from costing $200-300 up to $350-400. That's the \"bread and butter\" GPU. Im not talking that enthusiast crap. The cheapest \"current gen\" card is the \"$250\" (reallty $300) 3050. And in 6 years we've only seen about a 50% increase in performance epr dollar, with 2/3 of that happening 4 years ago with the 16 series. \n\nThe entire budget GPU market is more or less GONE. $150-180 is entry level now. That's your RX 6400s and 1650s. And if not for AMD, we old 1060 and 580 owners would LITERALLY HAVE NO UPGRADE PATH. Youre in your own little world going on about \"luxury GPUs\" and sports cars and blah blah blah.\n\nhere I'm seeing people priced out of the market entirely. Theres a reason the 1060 is still one of the top cards on steam hardware survey. And the 1650...replaced it? That's WORSE! Seriously, how do you not understand that this market is just BROKEN? Full on broken.\n\nSo yeah I am gonna crap on your views here since it really does seem to reek of the typical elitism I see on these hardware subs. About 5-10 years ago it used to be full of people looking to typically spend $500-1000 on a computer. An ENTIRE COMPUTER.\n\nYour typical PC 10 years ago was like a i5 2500k with a 760 or something. And people were still buying FX CPUs and i3s and mixing them when 750 tis and stuff. \n\nAgain, these people are being full on PRICED OUT of the market. That's BAD. Well, unless you're a snotty elitist who doesnt care about affordable PC gaming, which sounds like half this sub sometimes. \n\n>That's exactly what it is right? You're broke so you're mad and blame them for being anti-poor and gatekeeping you. What an insanely narcissistic view. Guess what. They don't give a shit about your economic status. If they can get you to buy, and your market segment profitable enough, then you'll have an option.\n\nAh yes, more poor shaming. And yes, by your standard i AM poor. And apparently i dont deserve to game and should work harder or some crap. \n\nAgain, you might not like having your views challenged, but you're an economic right winger. \n\n>You've done literally nothing to challenge me. You were easily baited into revealing your far left bias and it's obvious you were triggered. You're triggered because you felt personally slighted. Classic narcissistic toxic left wing bullshit. You can't handle that I exist on here so you feel the need to attack me personally. It's pathetic and does your ideology no favors.\n\nHint, you dont need to bait me to show my bias. I wear it on my sleeve. Anyone who checks my profile can see Im fairly left wing. At least by capitalist standards. The amount of gatekeeping i get from actual anti capitalist leftists is astounding. But yeah, according to you, the mere suggestion that markets should work for the people and we shouldnt have to spend $300 on an entry level bottom of the barrel GPU apparently makes me a pinko commie. \n\nI really couldnt give a crap what someone of your ideological persuasion thinks of me, because i quite frankly stopped giving a crap what the \"right\" thinks about, well...anything any more. \n\nBut yeah, you ARE right wing, whether you'll admit it or not. As is most of this sub. And that bias is insufferable on here sometimes. As i said, bunch of upper class yuppies out of touch with the rest of the country, and the world while we're at it.",

You&#39;re broke so you&#39;re mad and blame them for being anti-poor and gatekeeping you. What an insanely narcissistic view. Guess what. They don&#39;t give a shit about your economic status. If they can get you to buy, and your market segment profitable enough, then you&#39;ll have an option.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ah yes, more poor shaming. And yes, by your standard i AM poor. And apparently i dont deserve to game and should work harder or some crap. </p>\n\n<p>Again, you might not like having your views challenged, but you&#39;re an economic right winger. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You&#39;ve done literally nothing to challenge me. You were easily baited into revealing your far left bias and it&#39;s obvious you were triggered. You&#39;re triggered because you felt personally slighted. Classic narcissistic toxic left wing bullshit. You can&#39;t handle that I exist on here so you feel the need to attack me personally. It&#39;s pathetic and does your ideology no favors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hint, you dont need to bait me to show my bias. I wear it on my sleeve. Anyone who checks my profile can see Im fairly left wing. At least by capitalist standards. The amount of gatekeeping i get from actual anti capitalist leftists is astounding. But yeah, according to you, the mere suggestion that markets should work for the people and we shouldnt have to spend $300 on an entry level bottom of the barrel GPU apparently makes me a pinko commie. </p>\n\n<p>I really couldnt give a crap what someone of your ideological persuasion thinks of me, because i quite frankly stopped giving a crap what the &quot;right&quot; thinks about, well...anything any more. </p>\n\n<p>But yeah, you ARE right wing, whether you&#39;ll admit it or not. As is most of this sub. And that bias is insufferable on here sometimes. As i said, bunch of upper class yuppies out of touch with the rest of the country, and the world while we&#39;re at it.</p>\n</div>",
