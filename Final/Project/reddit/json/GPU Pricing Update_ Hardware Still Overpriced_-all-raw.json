The image quality upgrade going from 1440p to 4K isn&#39;t really noticeable unless you&#39;re pixel peeping and/or have a very large monitor.  1440p High settings is gonna look a hell of a lot better than 4K Low settings.</p>\n\n<p>What you can get for half that price is still an insane upgrade over your GTX 970.  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1w9ZTmj_zX4?t=534\">Thanks to driver improvements RX 5700XTs perform the same as the GTX 1080 Ti and RTX 3060</a> and come up for $150-170 from time to time.   If you only buy NVIDIA you can snatch up an RTX 2070 for $200, though it is slightly slower than the 5700XT nowadays.</p>\n</div>",

In 2019, we only got a 1660 Ti to replace that roughly, which was a measly 35% improvement. Sure, the 2060 came out, but they wanted $350 for the thing, which was ridiculous. But after 3 years, you'd think we'd get something like that for $250. We didn't. \n\nThen nvidia did the same thing with the 3060, charged $330 for it and people acted like they were doing us a favor. I dont care what happens in $800 land, because no one should pay that much for GPUs in the first place unless you're some insane enthusiast. \n\nEither way, yeah, the 1080 ti was $700. And anything above that is a scam. \n\nBut yeah. Going back to my 1060 comparison, in 2021or 2022, i forget when it came out, but we got the 3050 for $250. It was just as 1660 ti with ray tracing. More stagnation. 4000 series, more price hikes, more stagnation. Performance per dollar only improved 50% on the nvidia side. IN SIX YEARS. That's insane. Historically before than we saw a doubling in performance every 3. For reference, the 2500k to the 7600k was also 50%, so we're at intel stagnation levels of price/performance. \n\nIt gets even worse down the stack. 2016 the 1050 ti was $140 MSRP and when i bought sold for around $180. Nowadays, you get a 1650 at that price range, a card that came out in 2018 and was only around 25% better than a 1050 ti. 1660 ti is around $230. In 2018 it was the 1660 and in 2016 it was the 1060 3 GB. Another paltry performance gain. 1070 in 2016. We got the 2060 in 2018. Then the 3060 and 3060 Ti in 2020/2021. More measly 50% gains roughly.\n\nYou get the idea. I couldnt care less about die sizes and OMG this is GA102, this is 104, blah blah blah. DOnt care. I care about \"what performance can i get for the money\", and honestly this level of stagnation is so bad it should be triggering anti trust investigations into the GPU market. Because something is fundamentally unhealthy here.\n\nIn order to double my last card, i needed to buy AMD, because AMD for some reason is selling their GPUs a whole tier of price lower than nvidia, which is what everyone should've been doing in the first place.\n\nif you want to know what i think GPU pricing would be fair, I'd say, take the cheapest RDNA2 cards over the past 3 months and about that.\n\n6600s for around $200 is fair. 6650 XTs for $250-300 is fair. 6700 XTs for $350-400 is fair. 6800s for around $500 is fair. 6950 XTs for $700 is fair. That's what the market should've looked like all along. Heck i just wish we had some serious budget options too. 6500 XT is a massive gap in performance down for not a lot less money. And the 6400 is just pathetic. 6500 XT should be like $120ish and the 6400 should be sub $100 IMO. And there should be some decent $160 option somewhere around 1660 ti level in there somewhere.",

The 2080 Ti is cut down 5%.\n\nYou got the numbers right for the 3080 and 2080 Ti. Not for the 1080 and 2080. The 2080 had 46/48 SMs and the 1080 had a fully enabled GP104 (20/20 SMs).\n\n>So the 3080 is roughly halfway between a 2080 and 2080 Ti in terms of SM count compared to the full die.\n\nThat's misleading, to say the least. The 3080 performs within 90% of a 3090, which features a nearly full GA102 and operates at comparable power levels. I'll take the 3090 Ti out of the equation because the 3090 Ti relies most of its performance uplift on the massive 450W TDP (which, in real-world testing, is closer to 480W for the reference FE model) rather than any actual architectural upgrades (it's only got 2 more SMs than the 3090). If you feed 3080s and 3090s with the same 480W (which isn't a far-fetched idea, given all those cards are based off the exact same die; if a 3090 Ti chip can take 480W, so can any other GA102 chip), most of the performance advantage of the 3090 Ti will be gone.\n\nUnlike the 3080, the 2080 and 1080 performed nowhere near the bigger models. Even with partially disabled chips, the 1080 Ti and 2080 Ti brutally outperformed their 104 siblings. The 1080 Ti was, in average, 35% faster than the 1080 at 4K. Meanwhile, the 2080 Ti still outperformed the 2080 by nearly 30%, and that's considering that, at the stock 250W TDP, it operated nearly 300Mhz below the 2080. As a reference, the 2080 had a 215W TDP. In other words, it had 67% the SMs but 86% the TDP. This is why so many AIB 2080 Tis would operate over 300W, which allowed them to operate at similar clock speeds to 2080 cards; even overclocked 2080s. The TU102 had no problems operating as fast as the TU104, as long as it had comparable power per SM (and adequate cooling to boot). Once you adjusted the cards to operate at similar clockspeeds, the 2080 Ti opened an even bigger performance advantage over the 2080.\n\nThe bottom line here is that, in the end of the day, what really matters is what chip your GPU has. Obviously, a full version of a chip will perform better than a partially disabled chip. However, the truth of the fact is that all cards that feature a same chip will perform relatively close to each other, just look at the 3080 and 3090 and how close they are to each other. Similarly, the 3060 Ti offers near-to-3070 levels of performance, and this comes ate no surprise as it features the same chip. Now, step down to the 3060 and there's a massive performance drop, they're nowhere near in performance. And that's easily explained by the 3060 using a lower tier chip. Of course, there are some exceptions, like the first GA106-powered RTX 3050s. In essence, because the GA107s weren't ready available at the time, the first 3050s to hit the market featured the GA106 instead of the GA107 which should have equipped it since the beginning. Reducing the GA106 to GA107 levels means the chip is massively capped at 2/3 its capacity. Obviously, this type of decision only serves as a temporary solution, given it makes no financial sense to commercialize chips at such reduced capacities. As a reference, the smallest GA102 - the 3080, still features a full fat 20 SMs more than a fully enabled GA104.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>This isn&#39;t true. The 3080 is cut down 19% from the full die, the 1080 and 2080 are cut down 36% and 33% respectively. The 2080 Ti is cut down 5%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You got the numbers right for the 3080 and 2080 Ti. Not for the 1080 and 2080. The 2080 had 46/48 SMs and the 1080 had a fully enabled GP104 (20/20 SMs).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So the 3080 is roughly halfway between a 2080 and 2080 Ti in terms of SM count compared to the full die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s misleading, to say the least. The 3080 performs within 90% of a 3090, which features a nearly full GA102 and operates at comparable power levels. I&#39;ll take the 3090 Ti out of the equation because the 3090 Ti relies most of its performance uplift on the massive 450W TDP (which, in real-world testing, is closer to 480W for the reference FE model) rather than any actual architectural upgrades (it&#39;s only got 2 more SMs than the 3090). If you feed 3080s and 3090s with the same 480W (which isn&#39;t a far-fetched idea, given all those cards are based off the exact same die; if a 3090 Ti chip can take 480W, so can any other GA102 chip), most of the performance advantage of the 3090 Ti will be gone.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the 3080, the 2080 and 1080 performed nowhere near the bigger models.

The RTX 3060 came after the 3060 Ti, and, if anything, it always regarded as terrible value, given the 3060 Ti offered over 33% more performance for 20% more money. If anything, the 3060 kickstarted Ampere's second-wave of cards - those that offered progressively worse performance-per-dollar. 1st-wave Ampere (3070, 3080 and 3060 Ti - not 3090 for obvious reasons) was the last time the market see Nvidia launch truly compelling products.\n\nCool, except it was exactly $400, which was way too expensive for a 60 series card, and keep in mind, does nothing for any of us in the sub $400 market.\n\nI dont care how great these cards were for rich people. Im a normal person who buys $200-300 GPUs. Your arguments do not connect with me at all. Because I see it as \"1060 -> 1660 ti/super -> 3050\".

JESUS.\n\n>CPUs can't scale like GPUs because CPU workloads are highly sequential, as opposed to graphics which are tremendously parallel workloads. It's easier to scale compute units than it is to make those compute units faster, this is why GPUs improve faster than CPUs.\n\nJesus christ you're dense.\n\nWay to miss the point.\n\n>The 3060 Ti was a great GPU. It was brutally faster than anything priced below it, and it delivered performance over the $699 2080 Super... for $399. If you want to compare it with Pascal, it offered nearly double the performance of the 1070 which shared the same MSRP. Plus, you had DLSS and RT. So, in just two generations, the 3060 Ti was offering twice the performance per dollar (even more if you adjust for inflation), plus DLSS and RT support.\n\nCool, except it LITERALLY DOES NOTHING FOR THOSE OF US WITH 1060S.\n\nJesus christ you're dense. It's like you're literally the \"well ackshully\" guy. Like holy ####, touch grass. Seriously. \n\nI ain't doing this any more. You are clueless.\n\nIf you wanna look at what i consider good pricing, look at the AMD side of things. I literally bought a 6650 XT, which is almost on par with your lauded 3060 Ti for **$230**. That's a deal. Nvidia is price gauging. The only decently priced cards for what they offer right now are the AMD 6000 series.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/MnZF6q1\n\nSeriously, I got my deal at $1.78 according to that chart. THAT'S a deal.

If we factor inflation, the RTX 3050 is actually cheaper than the GTX 1060 was.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the 16 series was weak and provided only a 35% improvement in price/performance. The 3050 was garbage. And ERMAHGERD INFLATION, THAT JUSTIFIES EVERYTHING.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I never saw anyone say this. The RTX 3060 came after the 3060 Ti, and, if anything, it always regarded as terrible value, given the 3060 Ti offered over 33% more performance for 20% more money. If anything, the 3060 kickstarted Ampere&#39;s second-wave of cards - those that offered progressively worse performance-per-dollar. 1st-wave Ampere (3070, 3080 and 3060 Ti - not 3090 for obvious reasons) was the last time the market see Nvidia launch truly compelling products.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Cool, except it was exactly $400, which was way too expensive for a 60 series card, and keep in mind, does nothing for any of us in the sub $400 market.</p>\n\n<p>I dont care how great these cards were for rich people. Im a normal person who buys $200-300 GPUs. Your arguments do not connect with me at all. Because I see it as &quot;1060 -&gt; 1660 ti/super -&gt; 3050&quot;. That&#39;s a HORRID improvement in 6 years. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As was the 3080.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>yeah and 80 cards normally go for $500-600.</p>\n\n<p>Besides youre missing the point that now there are literally three tiers of card above that and we&#39;re a whole tier lower than 2017.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&#39;s because performance per dollar has been stagnant since the 3080 was launched, back in 2020.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>it&#39;s been stagnant for far longer if you&#39;re NOT in the $800 segment. JESUS.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>CPUs can&#39;t scale like GPUs because CPU workloads are highly sequential, as opposed to graphics which are tremendously parallel workloads. It&#39;s easier to scale compute units than it is to make those compute units faster, this is why GPUs improve faster than CPUs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jesus christ you&#39;re dense.</p>\n\n<p>Way to miss the point.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The 3060 Ti was a great GPU. It was brutally faster than anything priced below it, and it delivered performance over the $699 2080 Super... for $399. If you want to compare it with Pascal, it offered nearly double the performance of the 1070 which shared the same MSRP. Plus, you had DLSS and RT. So, in just two generations, the 3060 Ti was offering twice the performance per dollar (even more if you adjust for inflation), plus DLSS and RT support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Cool, except it LITERALLY DOES NOTHING FOR THOSE OF US WITH 1060S.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus christ you&#39;re dense. It&#39;s like you&#39;re literally the &quot;well ackshully&quot; guy. Like holy ####, touch grass. Seriously. </p>\n\n<p>I ain&#39;t doing this any more. You are clueless.</p>\n\n<p>If you wanna look at what i consider good pricing, look at the AMD side of things. I literally bought a 6650 XT, which is almost on par with your lauded 3060 Ti for <strong>$230</strong>. That&#39;s a deal. Nvidia is price gauging. The only decently priced cards for what they offer right now are the AMD 6000 series.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/MnZF6q1\">https://imgur.com/MnZF6q1</a></p>\n\n<p>Seriously, I got my deal at $1.78 according to that chart. THAT&#39;S a deal. Even your 3060 Ti is still a worse value than almost the entirety of AMD&#39;s offerings right now. Only flagship cards are a worse value.</p>\n</div>",
