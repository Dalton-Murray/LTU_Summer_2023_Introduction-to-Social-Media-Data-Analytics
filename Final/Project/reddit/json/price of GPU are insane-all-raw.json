You are 100% right of course but let me be realistic when it comes to games. \n\nI'm 3x year old. I am wealthy now. I remember when 1070 came out. I spend so many months saving. Now I could buy a 4090, I have the income, I have no kids, but why? I actually did spend the money mind you. I bought myself a Sony A6600 with entire Sigma Prime Lens Trio and A 18-50 Zoom lens and that wasn't enough so I went and got a Super Zoom Sony 70-350mm. When you sum it up it's more then a 4090.\n\nBut thats not the issue. Since I'm also old let me put it like this. \n\nWhen UT came out you needed a GPU or you were stuck at playing a 320x240 Software 400x300 if you had a really good CPU. UT was the game everyone played. It was the top game. Same goes for everything down the line. Half Life, Half Life 2, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, Red Alert 2, CnC Generals, Company of Heroes.\n\nAll these games needed better, newer, more capable hardware. \n\nOh your GPU can't do the new version of DirectX too bad, oh your GPU can't do T&L too bad. You were blocked from playing games.\n\nNow on my 1070 with 1080p60 am I blocked by anything? \n\nNew games keep coming out, I see no issue or reason to upgrade.\n\nElden Ring? I could run it.\nGhostwire Tokyo? I could run it. \nTL Warhammer III? I could run it. \nOW2? I could run it technically but I am never playing a Blizzard game in my life every again no matter the quality.\n\nThe point being. Aside from the occasional mega hit that requires a good GPU most of the game that people play these days don't need one.\n\nVallorat, CS GO, Genshin Impact, Apex, Warzone, LoL, Dota 2, Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, PubG, Fall Guys and so on for the normal people.\n\nAll of these will run really well on 1080p60 with a 1060 6 GB. \n\nFor the older guys like me Paradox Games, Dyson Sphere, Civ, Humankind, Anno 1800, Cities Skylines, and so on... they're all good with 1060.\n\nAnd I mean you're seeing this with the PS5. I have one. It's sitting collecting dust because what am I going to play on it? People seem to be playing 95% PS4 games on it. And then an occasional hit comes out you play it for 1~4 weeks and you go back to the social games like FFXIV or Genshin or Apex etc... \n\nSo it won't be the ending of PC gaming, it's going to be a stagnation of PC gaming. And more and more people will join because the entry level is going to be really cheap.",

You got 1650s, 6400s, 6500 XTs, 1660s, 1660 tis, etc. all selling for within a few dollars of each other, with varying levels of performance. \n\nLike...the LOW LOW end market has ALWAYS been like this. You ALWAYS have poor GPU pricing at the low low end where you vary between say a GT 710 (bad) and say a 1050 ti (good), since that is now a 6 year old card and should rightfully be low end.\n\nBut normally....the NEW 50 cards are in that price range. And you always had good options in that price range. I remember when I got into PC gaming, you could get cards as good as the HD 3850 for like $130. You could get 4770s, 4830s, and 4850s for less than $200, and those cards rocked a lot of the time. You could get the GTS 250, and later the 5750 and even the 5770 (although that was closer to $200) at the time. Those were solid cards.\n\nAnd later on, stuff like the GTS 450, GTX 750 Ti, 950, and 1050 Ti were all solid buys in the sub $200 range. You never got the best at that price range, you never got something super futureproof, but it was a price tier in its own right where you could get some value cards for around $150ish.\n\nThat market is drying up. The sub $100 market is just about GONE, we're selling 1030s for like $120 still last I looked which is freaking pathetic since that card should've gone for like $80 at launch. And we're still selling stuff like 1650s, 6400s, and 6500 XTs at that price range. THose cards have been down there for FOUR YEARS now, and there has been zero improvement per dollar. If anything, it's a regression. And with the $350-400 range being the new \"mid range\" and it seems like they're trying to turn the $200-300 area into the new \"budget\" category and the sub $200 market as that \"you're ####ed\" category, the market is just broken. \n\nTo be fair i blame nvidia more than AMD at the moment for this. AMD has had good value deals on the 6600 and similar cards in the mid range range, which is quite frankly where they should've been all along (remember they cost $330-400 at launch), but ultimately, the low end of the market is feeling squeezed out, hard.",
